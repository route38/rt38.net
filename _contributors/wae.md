## What's vsdev?

vsdev: irreverent, freewheeling technical commentary for the discerning
nerd since 2013.  Written by a man who loves Linux, laptops, and Ruby
for everybody who loves running Ruby on Linux laptops.  You're gonna get
unfettered access into the unfiltered thought patterns of a technically
minded ex-technologist making his way into his next great challenge in
life, and if you're at all like me, you'll find inspiration for the
road ahead.

## Who's this git, then?

I gestated in a laboratory deep under the Tennessee hills until early
1988 when I was unleashed upon the world.  I first encountered a computer
at age six when, in the classroom of Eleanor Wilson, I cut my teeth on
an old Apple ][ and a still-shining Macintosh LC 575.  I first tinkered
with programming on my grandmother's 286, running MS-DOS 5.0, with
the QBasic language when I was 10 or 11 years old.  My first proper
programming experience was on Debian Linux at age nineteen, when I took
the college course that changed my life: Computer Science 102 at the
University of Tennessee.  Somewhere along the way, I developed a deep
appreciation for the rock and pop styles of the 1970s and 1980s, the
eight-bit legends of video gaming, and the peerless industrial design
of Apple Inc.

Today, I'm working on making my next move into the world of finance
and accounting, with an eye on making inroads toward directorship of
a nonprofit organization.  I will always love computers and computing,
but it's just not my calling.  I have the good people of The Muse
Knoxville and the Volunteer Ministry Center to thank for awakening
me to this truth: that behind-the-scenes altruism is my real calling.

In my spare time, I love to collect vinyl records, maintain my websites,
tinker around with Linux (almost every computer I own has run it at
one point or another), play video games, take photographs, and experiment
with computer casemodding.  Here are six more things you should know:


1. My second language is French, and I studied Japanese in college.

2. C++ and Ruby are my favorite programming languages.

3. I love to write and maintain three blogs, a private journal, and a
   fiction project that has grown to encompass five volumes and another
   volume or two worth of ancillary material.

4. Paul Simon is my favorite male vocalist of all time.  The
   incomparable Florence Welch is his counterpart among the ladies.
   My favorite three albums of all time are _Physical Graffiti_ by Led
   Zeppelin, _Graceland_ by Paul Simon, and _How Big, How Blue, How
   Beautiful_ by Florence + the Machine.

5. I can count to twenty in five languages: English, French, Japanese,
   Spanish, and German.  I can also say "hello," "goodbye," "I love
   you," and "I am running naked in the street" in these languages.
   In four of these languages, I can also ask a few more basic
   questions.  (I speak French fluently, so this all is trivial in
   that language.)

6. Related to the previous point, I have a favorite song in each of
   these languages: in English, "The Boxer" by Simon & Garfunkel; in
   French, "Non, je ne regrette rien" by Edith Piaf; in Japanese,
   "Headbanger!!" by BabyMetal; in Spanish, "Amor prohibido" by Selena;
   and in German, "Meine SÃ¼nde" by Megaherz.
