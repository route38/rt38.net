My name's W. Anthony Ellison.  I'm an irredeemable nerd, Ruby and JavaScript guy, entrepreneur, football fan, photographer, Linux lover, video gamer, and longtime Linux enthusiast.  Some things I like include the Denver Broncos, Gulp.js, Soviet cameras, walking up the sides of mountains, and pushing a hundred pounds over my head in the gym.

If I had to condense myself into a six-item list -- and I do -- it'd contain these nodes:

0.  I'm bilingual: English (native) and French (high school, college, and self-study).

1.  Ruby is my favourite programming language, but JavaScript comes close enough to also have a sticker on the back of my laptop.

2.  I'm currently working on a novel.  It doesn't have a title yet, but it does have a cast of characters I've grown to love.

3.  I'm a voracious reader and own a shedload of books.

4.  Markdown is my favourite markup language next to LaTeX.
    
5.  Because I can count to twenty in at least five languages including English, I can count reps in the gym using a different language for each set: one, two, three, _uno_, _dos_, _trés_, _un_, _deux_, _trois_, _eins_, _zwei_, _drei_, 一, 二, 三.
