Neither of the examples is particularly pertinent to the branding bible;
I just happen to like these photos.</p>

<p>Probably my favorite musical duo of all time.

<p>
Florence + the Machine are one of my favorite bands in existence.
Between powerful songwriting and Florence Welch's amazing voice, there's
not much here to dislike.  I fell in love with Florence thanks to
Pandora, where I first heard "Dog Days," and I had to have a copy of the
album <em>Lungs</em>.  I went from that one to <em>Ceremonials</em>,
wanting to experience her greatness in chronological order, and then I
got a copy of <em>How Big&hellip;</em> soon thereafter.

<p>
You know you're good when Beyonc&eacute; herself cites you as an
influence, and she did, for her album <em>4</em> released in 2011.
Welch herself cites Grace Slick as her primary influence, and I must say
I'm rather a fan of Airplane-era Grace Slick vocals, so I guess it fits.
I wonder how a cover of &ldquo;The Sound of Silence&rdquo; would sound
-- she did a bang-up job of &ldquo;Stand By Me&rdquo; for a Final
Fantasy soundtrack.

<p> I've spent dozens of hours with Florence's music.  It's hard to say
what's their best work.  &ldquo;Delilah&rdquo; speaks to me rather
deeply on a personal level, as do &ldquo;Third Eye&rdquo; and a lot of
her other songs from <em>How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful</em>.  It's no
exaggeration to say that that's one of my favorite albums in recorded
music, an indispensable part of my digital music library alongside
<em>Graceland</em> by Paul Simon, <em>Kind of Blue</em> by Miles Davis,
<em>Led Zeppelin IV</em>, <em>Dark Side of the Moon</em> by Pink Floyd,
and <em>Hotel California</em> by the Eagles.  (Is it double-dipping if I
put <em>Lungs</em> in the mix along with <em>Sounds of Silence</em>
(Simon &amp; Garfunkel) and <em>Invisible Empire // Crescent Moon</em>
by KT Tunstall?  Gosh, I hope not.)

<h2>Blockquotes</h2> <p>Blockquotes should be used judiciously to quote
long spans of text.  The final citation at the end should link to the
text, if it is online.</p>

<h3>Blockquote Example</h3>

<p>This is the story of the Tower of Babel.

<blockquote>
<p>Now the whole world had one language and a common speech.  As people
moved eastward, they found a plain in Shinar and settled there.</p>

<p>They said to each other, &ldquo;Come, let's make bricks and bake them
thoroughly.&rdquo;  They used brick instead of stone, and tar for mortar.
Then they said, &ldquo;Come, let us build ourselves a city, with a tower that
reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves;
otherwise, we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the <span class='chain-textsc'>lord</span> came down to see the
city and the tower the people were building.  The <span
class='chain-textsc'>lord</span> said, &ldquo;If as one people speaking
the same language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to
do will be impossible for them.  Come, let us go down and confuse their
language so they will not understand each other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So the <span class='chain-textsc'>lord</span> scattered them from
there all over the earth, and they stopped building the city.  That is
why it was called Babel &mdash; because there the <span
class='chain-textsc'>lord</span> confused the language of the whole
world.  From there the <span class='chain-textsc'>lord</span> scattered
them over the face of the whole earth.</p>

<h2>Pull Quotes</h2>

<p>Pull quotes are blockquotes pulled right to highlight significant
parts of an article.  I have not used pull quotes in the past at Route
38, but I plan to do so going forward.</p>

<h3>Pull Quote Example</h3>

<div class='pull-right chain-wide-3 chain-pull-quote'>
  <blockquote>
  
  <p>We can by the principle of induction prove that a loop
  is correct&hellip;by proving it is correct for one
  execution.</p>
  
  </blockquote>
</div>

<p>Since the bodies of loops encompass state transition sequences of
their own, we can by the principle of induction prove that a loop is
correct regardless of the number of executions by proving it is correct
for one execution, with the proviso that the predicate under which the
loop operates is also correct, which can be proved with predicate logic.
We operate under the assumption that subroutines represent execution
states and that function calls represent state transitions. This makes
Cleanroom amenable to being used with C, Ada, Perl, Ruby, C++, and other
languages that support procedural programming. In systems with object
orientation, such as Java, calling methods on objects replaces calling
subroutines. Any other important difference is merely syntactic in
nature.</p>

<h2>Lists</h2>

<p>Lists are used, obviously, for presenting content in list format.
Unordered lists are customiarily used for content presentable in such
fashion that the order is not important.  An example, this being of
Britcoms I have watched:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Are You Being Served?</em></li>
<li><em>Last of the Summer Wine</em></li>
<li><em>Keeping Up Appearances</em></li>
<li><em>Fawlty Towers</em></li>
<li><em>Waiting For God</em></li>
<li><em>My Family</em></li>
<li><em>Coupling</em></li>
<li><em>Grace &amp; Favour</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Ordered lists are used where order is significant.  Example of an
ordered list describing what ought to be your favorite <em>passe-temps</em>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Locate the power button and turn on the computer.</li>
<li>Type in your username and password when prompted.</li>
<li>Open Google Chrome and navigate to <a href="https://www.vsdev.org">https://www.vsdev.org</a>.</li>
<li>Keep calm.</li>
<li>Read VSDev.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Code Snippets</h2>

<p>Code snippets are used at VSDev to illustrate concepts in posts about
programming and other languages.  As such, since this is a blog about
programming by a programmer, they are indispensable.  Code snippets
should follow the general code style guidelines in the Master Notebook
with a few changes:</p>

<ul>

<li>Lines should be shorter to facilitate reading on mobile devices,
particularly the narrow screens of smartphones, without horizontally
scrolling.</li>

<li>Snippets should be brief -- no more than twenty lines -- unless such
length is warranted.</li>

<li>Abstracting languages like Sass and Haml should be used instead of
CSS and HTML, in the name of brevity.</li>

</ul>
