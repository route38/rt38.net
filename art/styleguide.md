The standard language of vsdev.org is English.

## Place Names

All places should be named by their traditional English name, if one
exists and is preferred in English for that place.  In rare cases where
foreign names are preferred in English, they should be used.  Names as
used in _The New York Times_, _The Washington Post_, or by the
Associated Press, are considered normative.  The American usage is
considered standard.

American cities, with the exception of the 33 listed below, should be
given with their state, e.g. _Missoula, MT_; _Crossville, TN_; _Worms,
NE_.

## Usage, Mechanics, and Punctuation

The usual dialect of English used at VSDev is American English.  In the
absence of specific indications in this style guide, the following
reference works are assumed to be normative:

* _The Little, Brown Handbook_: Fourth Edition or later
* _The Associated Press Stylebook_: 2015 Edition or later
* _The Oxford American Dictionary_: Third Edition or later
* _The Purdue Online Writing Lab_: Located at
  <https://owl.english.purdue.edu>.

### Punctuation and Numbers

VSDev observes the usual English punctuation conventions.  The Oxford
comma _is used_, as is the Oxford semicolon when serial lists are
delimited by semicolons rather than by commas.  When used, punctuation
goes inside the quote, with a comma used to terminate a phrase within
quote marks.  Single quote marks are nested within double quote marks.

Open compound words are not hyphenated unless used in an adjectival
form, or are so listed in the dictionary or accepted as common usage.

Use commas in numbers, grouping numbers by thousands.  Use commas in
personal titles that follow the name.  Do not repeat a person's title if
it is used as part of their name.  Use a colon to set off second clauses
when they are emphasized.

In date ranges, never omit the century at either end of the range, even
when it is the same at both ends.

Spell even multiples of ten, and all integers less than or equal to
ten.  For numbers greater than one hundred, write them as numerals
except for even multiples of one hundred, and so on for successive
orders of magnitude.

### Formatting

Text should be presented at a legible size.  Faces used for body content
must support regular, italic, and bold type.  Italics should be used for
the names of major creative works, including but not limited to:

* Magazines
* Books (e.g., novels, novellas, nonfiction works)
* Academic journals
* Plays of three or more acts
* Long poems
* Musical albums
* Motion pictures
* Television and Internet shows
* Operas
* Musicals
* Works of art, including sculptures, paintings, photographs,
  architectural marvels, and installations
* Newspapers
* Individual planes, trains, ships, and other forms of transport with
  specific names

Italicize words that are emphasized or referred to.  Also italicize
foreign terms and certain explanations.

Bold type should be used for more intense emphasis than italics, and for
section and page headings (except where stylistic considerations dictate
otherwise).

### Measurement and Mathematics

The official measurement system of VSDev is the International System,
also called _metric_, as used in metricated Anglophone countries such as
Canada and Australia.  In particular, VSDev patterns its use of metric
on the Canadian uses of these measures.

VSDev defines several convenience units close to their imperial
equivalents, named in the same way as their American counterparts.  A
metric foot is equal to thirty centimeters.  A pound is equal to five
hundred grams.  A pint is equal to five hundred milliliters.

Measures in the American building trades are quoted in customary units,
and this usage is preserved at VSDev.  Measurements of magnetic tape,
customarily quoted in fractions of an inch, are also presented in
customary units, as are sizes of sheet film.

Where relevant, VSDev fitness posts retain the traditional pound-based
measurements of barbell loads and exercise resistance.

The policy of VSDev is, at the present time, to convert athlete
measurables into their metric equivalents.  For example, recently
drafted Denver Broncos offensive lineman Garett Bolles is 195.6 cm tall
and weighs 135.2 kg, while former Bronco returner Trindon Holliday
weighs 77 kg and stands at 165.1 cm, and your humble blogmaster is 176
cm tall and weighs 100 kg.

### Gendered Words

Do not use gendered words (for the most part).  They are, strictly
speaking, correct though dated from a linguistic standpoint.  They are
artifacts of the Latin influence upon English grammar, and were out of
place even at the time of Middle English, which had dropped gendered
nouns aside from those referring to sentient beings.  There are two
exceptions to this rule:

1. For terms that end in _-man_ or _-woman_, go ahead and use these if
   the gender of the person to which the word refers is used, and use
   the suffix _-person_ (and _-people_) if the antecedent is either
   unknown or of mixed, multiple, gender.  Where possible, use the
   mixed-gender word _and_ more specific terms, preferably ungendered
   ones.

2. The only gendered pair that is acceptable in some quarters is _actor_
   versus _actress_.  This particular rule is followed here at VSDev.

Examples of Exception 1 in action:

> OK: Congresswoman Jenkins (G-9) and her colleague Congressman Mayer
> (D-8) voted against the measure to allow liberals to shoot rocks at
> conservatives.  Congressman Mayer, when asked about the matter, said
> only that "it opens the door for similar laws that would let
> conservatives pelt liberals with rocks."

Please don't throw rocks at people you disagree with.

> WRONG: Congressperson Jenkins (G-9) and her colleague, Congressperson
> Mayer (D-8)...

And please don't use gender-neutral language when, as above, it makes
you sound like a twit.

> BETTER: Twelve Congresspersons, including Representative Jenkins (G-9)
> and Representative Meyer (D-8), voted against the measure that would
> allow liberals to fire rocks at conservatives using slingshots.

A touch wordy, but better.

> BEST: A plurality of Congresspeople, including local Representatives
> Anita Jenkins (G-9) and Bill Meyer (D-8), voted against measures
> permitting liberals to pelt conservatives with rocks and requiring
> registered Republicans to wear their affiliation on their sleeve.
> When questioned, Representative Jenkins stated: "Republicans usually
> are pretty vocal anyway, and I don't want them enacting a law down the
> line that lets them hit me with rocks."

Please don't throw rocks at Republicans.  Most of them are armed.

### The T Word

When writing about Trans people, use the pronouns they indicate they
would like to be used, with the provision that they are standard
English.  For example, Olympic athlete Caitlyn Jenner identifies as a
woman, and so she indicates that the feminine pronouns be used; adult
film star Buck Angel identifies as a man, and so he indicates that the
masculine pronouns be used.  Some Trans people reject gendered pronouns
and prefer the neuter "singular 'they'."  This usage is wholeheartedly
accepted at VSDev since this site favors the "singular 'they'" anyway.

### The R Words

The rather controversial name of a certain NFL franchise located in
Washington, D.C., shall not be used.  _Washington NFL Team_ or similar
shall be used until such time as they change their name.  (Also, Dan
Snyder is an anus.)

Another rather controversial word, used to refer to persons of limited
mental capacity, or to idea or concepts deemed stupid, shall not be
used.  Any variation upon this term is also verboten.  If you want to
call somebody a fuckwit, or a dumbass, or a pinhead, or a Trump voter,
be my guest.  But the R-word is off-limits.

### The F Word

A certain six-letter term, an outdated term for a bundle of sticks or a
pejorative term for a homosexual man.  In British English, a _faggot_ is
a pork dish commonly consisting of minced heart and liver, wrapped in
bacon, with onion and breadcrumbs.  This is the only usage of the term
deemed permissible within the confines of VSDev, in the unlikely event
that I lose enough of my good taste to acquire a tongue for British
food.  (The faggot is also called the _savory duck_, particularly in
Yorkshire and nearby areas.)

Obviously, this term shouldn't be used to refer to a gay man.

### Certain ethnic terms

The word "Gypsy" should not be used to refer to the Romani people of
Europe.
