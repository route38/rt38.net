        <em class='book-title'>On Writing Well</em> by
        <span class='author'>William Zinsser</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        An excellent guide to writing nonfiction.  I make it a point to
        read this one at least every year.
      </dd>

      <dt class='book'>
        <em class='book-title'>Getting Things Done</em> by
        <span class='author'>David Allen</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The ultimate masterwork of modern productivity.  If you're too
        busy to read this book, that's why you need to read it.
      </dd>

        <em class='book-title'>Red Storm Rising</em> by
        <span class='author'>Tom Clancy</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A wonderful tale of tension and terror in the late Soviet era.
        Dated, but still wonderful.

      <dt>Bridge Over Troubled Water (1970, Columbia)</dt>
      <dd>
        The last Simon &amp; Garfunkel album, and in many ways, the
        best.  I'd rather be a hammer than a nail, yes I would.
      </dd>
                  
      <dt>Still Crazy After All These Years (1975, Columbia)</dt>
      <dd>
        My favorite Paul Simon album, along with <em>Graceland</em>.
        Just slip out the back, Jack!
      </dd>

      <dt>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below (2004, Arista)</dt>
      <dd>
        A mammoth OutKast album, still as fresh and relevant as it was
        13 years ago.  What's cooler than being cool?  Ice cold, of
        course.
      </dd>

      <dt>Lungs (2009, Moshi Moshi)</dt>
      <dd>
        Florence + the Machine's freshman effort and one of my favorite
        albums ever pressed.  You've got the love I need to see me
        through.

      <dt>Slackware 14.2 (amd64)</dt>
      <dd>
        On Sagarmatha.  Transferred from the SSD that once dwelt in
        Elbrus, with my home directory files sprawled out onto the
        second hard drive.  1.5 TB of storage space is probably
        overkill, but it's plenty of room for me to grow in.
      </dd>

      <dt>Windows 7 Pro (amd64)</dt>
      <dd>
        On Elbrus, using a spare SSD.  Apps practically slap against the
        back of the screen in Windows 7 with an SSD.  Performance is
        top-notch, especially after swapping in my 2.4 GHz motherboard.
      </dd>
                  
      <dt>Mac OS X Leopard</dt>
      <dd>
        On Clingmans Dome.  One of my personal favorite OS releases
        ever.  Takes me right back to 2007 just looking at it, but
        Leopard also manages somehow to be friendlier than many modern
        OSes also.
