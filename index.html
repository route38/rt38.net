      <dt>Heroes &amp; Thieves (2007, The Inc.)</dt>
      <dd>
        Vanessa Carlton's third album was pretty good.
        It was a massive flop commercially (selling 75,000 copies as
        of 2011), but I got it the day it came out.  And I loved it.
        Three words: "Fools Like Me."  Classic Nessa is best Nessa, and
        while I do love this album even today, I prefer
        <em>Harmonium</em> or <em>Be Not Nobody</em>.  Cool sidenote:
        Stevie Nicks (the woman, the myth, the legend!) provided backing
        vocals for "The One."
      </dd>

      <dt>Drastic Fantastic (2007, Relentless)</dt>
      <dd>
        KT Tunstall's sophomore album, an overall solid effort but
        overall lacking in the intimacy and warmth that makes Tunstall's
        other work so brilliant.  The rock listener in me loves
        everything about this album, from the disco-ball guitar on the
        front cover to the lovably power-pop-infused kiss-off that is "I
        Don't Want You Now."  But Tunstall's other work is just so much
        better than this album, at least by way of comparison.
      </dd>

      <dt>Wild Hope (2007, Firm/EMI)</dt>
      <dd>
        Mandy Moore is now better known as "an actress who can sing," as
        opposed to "a singer who can act."  This album is one of the
        first "coffee-sippin', Mac-usin', easy-livin'" albums I ever
        bought.  Moore collaborated with a bunch of other people I like,
        including Steve Tannen, Deb Talan, Michelle Branch, and Rachael
        Yamagata.  The result has aged rather well, and 19-year-old me
        could not get enough of this album.
      </dd>

      <dt>Kind of Blue (1959, Columbia)</dt>
      <dd>
        The greatest assembly of jazz talent ever committed to a
        recording medium.  The less I say, the better, but hear this:
        buy this record if you don't own a copy.

      <dt>Slackware 14.2 (amd64)</dt>
      <dd>
        On Sagarmatha.  Transferred from the SSD that once dwelt in
        Elbrus, with my home directory files sprawled out onto the
        second hard drive.  1.5 TB of storage space is probably
        overkill, but it's plenty of room for me to grow in.
      </dd>

      <dt>Windows 7 Pro (amd64)</dt>
      <dd>
        On Elbrus, using a spare SSD.  Apps practically slap against the
        back of the screen in Windows 7 with an SSD.  Performance is
        top-notch, especially after swapping in my 2.4 GHz motherboard.

      <dt>Mac OS X Leopard</dt>
      <dd>
        On Clingmans Dome.  One of my personal favorite OS releases
        ever.  Takes me right back to 2007 just looking at it, but
        Leopard also manages somehow to be friendlier than many modern
        OSes also.
