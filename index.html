        <em class='book-title'>On Writing Well</em> by
        <span class='author'>William Zinsser</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        An excellent guide to writing nonfiction.  I make it a point to
        read this one at least every year.
      </dd>

      <dt class='book'>
        <em class='book-title'>Getting Things Done</em> by
        <span class='author'>David Allen</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The ultimate masterwork of modern productivity.  If you're too
        busy to read this book, that's why you need to read it.
      </dd>

      <dt class='book'>
        <em class='book-title'>Red Storm Rising</em> by
        <span class='author'>Tom Clancy</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A wonderful tale of tension and terror in the late Soviet era.
        Dated, but still wonderful.

      <dt>Bridge Over Troubled Water (1970, Columbia)</dt>
      <dd>
        The last Simon &amp; Garfunkel album, and in many ways, the
        best.
      </dd>
                  
      <dt>Still Crazy After All These Years (1975, Columbia)</dt>
      <dd>
        My favorite Paul Simon album, along with <em>Graceland</em>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below (2004, Arista)</dt>
      <dd>
        A mammoth OutKast album, still as fresh and relevant as it was
        13 years ago.
      </dd>

      <dt>Lungs (2009, Moshi Moshi)</dt>
      <dd>
        Florence + the Machine's freshman effort and one of my favorite
        albums ever pressed.  &hearts;

      <dt>Slackware 14.2 (amd64)</dt>
      <dd>
        On Elbrus.  My first serious attempt at using Slack.  I like it
        better than Debian, which are words I never thought I'd write.
      </dd>

      <dt>Windows 7 Pro (amd64)</dt>
      <dd>
        On Elbrus, using an extra hard drive.  Meh.
      </dd>
                  
      <dt>Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (amd64)</dt>
      <dd>
        On Sagarmatha.  Configured for security with an encrypted root
        hard drive and an encrypted home directory.  Is it overkill?
        Probably not.
      </dd>

      <dt>Mac OS X Leopard</dt>
      <dd>
        One of my personal favorite OS releases ever.  Takes me right
        back to 2007 just looking at it, but Leopard also manages
        somehow to be friendlier than many modern OSes also.
      </dd>

      <dt>Mac OS X Tiger</dt>
      <dd>
        On Vinson.  Performs better than, by all rights, it ought to.
        It's almost enough to make Vinson useful for day-to-day
        computing.
