The most powerful ally in your job search process is of course the interviewer -- only he or she can decide, on the basis of speaking with you, whether you'd be a good fit for his or her open position.  Because of that, the interview must be a dialogue -- both you and the interviewer must actively discuss the position that is being considered, and you must demonstrate to him or her that you're a good fit for her department and for the work being done.

### Freeze frame!

That being said, how many of you out there in the blogosphere freeze up when confronted with the need to strut your stuff in an interview?  Among the recent college grads reading this, I'd imagine a few hands at least would go up, and the rest of you would just be bluffing.  It can be hard to think of examples of times where you've shown the world what you're made of -- and for whatever reason.  I volunteer three reasons below.

1.  Interviews are unique in that they put you on the spot.  Very few people have total recall when all eyes are on them, and the few who do are probably Hollywood actors.

2.  Interviews are also (fairly) unique in that they're rather high-stakes for all involved.  Those interviewing you don't want to risk making a hiring mistake, which could be very costly indeed -- and you don't want to risk not having a job, especially if you're unemployed or underemployed.

3.  When you've been out of work for a while, you get depressed and forget how awesome you are.  When you forget how awesome you are, you stumble through interview situations.  The easy answer to this dilemma is to not stumble through interview situations, and that only works by reminding yourself of how awesome you are.

So how do you [stop being sad and be awesome instead](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veINDSTr3r4)?  Take inventory of all the good shit you've ever done.  Remind yourself that you _can_ do quality work, and that just like shopping for a suit, you simply haven't found the right fit just yet.

### Your cornerman

A boxer always has someone in his corner of the ring, keeping him focused on the prize -- even if the prize is to make it to the end of the bout with as few injuries as possible.  Whether you're talking about Tyson, Holyfield, Ali, Pacquiao, De la Hoya, any of them -- they wouldn't be the boxers they were (or are) without their cornermen.  Likewise, a race car driver always has someone in the cockpit with him, even though that man is standing in the pits -- they're called race engineers.  Felipe Massa wouldn't be the driver he is without Rob Smedley, for the best known example in F1.

You don't get a cornerman or race engineer in a job interview -- you're entirely on your own.  Actually, that's codswallop -- you have at least one cornerman: your resume.  But there's another man in the corner, something you (yes, YOU!) can assemble at your own home without any special design skills: a work portfolio.

### You want me to create what?

Those in the creative trades know exactly what I'm talking about: a folder or binder full of pretty pictures (or sexy layouts) of all the cool shit they've made or written over the years.  A writer's portfolio is her best friend when trying to line up a new gig, since nobody would hire a writer that couldn't write.  An artist's portfolio is no different: it shows his vision, his interpretation of various artistic ideals, or his unique approach to sculpting turds out of aluminium.  (Sorry, lost my train of thought.)  A photographer might include her most moving, highest selling, or simply her favorite photos.  A web designer could include screenshots of pages he's made.

But what do you do if you don't have a job that you can easily sell visually, like if you're a staff musician or a software developer?  If you're a musician, it might suffice to include critical reviews and listener feedback on your work, so long as they're positive -- if you can win over critics and listeners, you're probably good at what you do.  But I'm not a musician -- as I say, I couldn't carry a tune in a bucket to save my life.

We in the software trade straddle the fine line between art and science.  We may not sculpt turds out of aluminium or commit raw emotion to celluloid (or a CCD), but we let you share your pictures of aluminium turds and raw emotion.  We may not be able to take you to Bora Bora in words or make you salivate with a painting of tiramisu, but we help you plan your trip to Bora Bora and show you how to make and paint tiramisu.  (Yum.)  If we could do those things, with a master's competence and spirit, in addition to being software crafters, we'd be bringing our pay packets home in dumper trucks and probably hobnobbing with Atwood, Gruber, and the rest of the high-profile blogosphere.  Moreover, confidentiality agreements are as mainstream in programming circles as Model M keyboards and Jolt Cola, so not so much as a semicolon of what we spend our 80 hours a week on can escape the confines of the office.  But that shouldn't stop you from describing the high-level architecture of a program or subprogram, and why it was designed the way it was -- if you had input as to how it was designed.

### Well, why shouldn't that stop me?

A work portfolio isn't just a place to accumulate work.  It's a place to put what people have _said_ about your work, which speaks more loudly than the work itself.  Think about it in these terms:

1.  Your Ruby example is very sophisticated and even handles obscure Unicode characters, but was it delivered on time and did it meet spec?

2.  You might have delivered your Ruby code on time and under budget, and it might have met spec entirely, but were you an insufferable dickhead while working on it, or were you actually a pretty cool guy?

3.  You may be god's gift to JavaScript programmers, but do others come to you for advice or run away from you?

4.  Which are you: Dilbert, Wally, Alice, or PHB?  Is your uniform gold, blue, or red?  Are you Bugs, Daffy, or Elmer?  They're odd questions, but they gauge your fit into the company culture.  If you're an Elmer Fudd amongst a group of Bugs Bunnies and Daffy Ducks, good fucking luck to you.

I tried linking to an online portfolio -- namely my GitHub profile -- on my resume, but there were problems with this approach.

1.  My GitHub is uncurated.  I stash a little bit of everything there, from old projects to my blog.  It's in constant flux and by virtue of being my work repository, it isn't a curated list of my best work.  It isn't even a curated list of my worst work.

2.  My GitHub is _boring_.  Nobody wants to sit and read hundreds of lines of source code for no good reason.  When time is of the essence and you're looking for the JavaScript dude you needed yesterday, you can't afford to spend a lazy afternoon reading one candidate's "portfolio."

3.  It plain didn't work.  I didn't have the bits sitting right there in front of the interviewer, and regardless of how proactive your hiring manager actually is on the job, she doesn't want to waste any effort she doesn't need to -- if it doesn't make her a better manager, or indeed help her manage her employees, it's not important.  I got more action out of linking people to this very blog instead of my GitHub profile.

So I decided to open WordPerfect, comb through my GitHub and old projects from UT, and provide a curated glimpse into how I operate.  Because I have limited professional experience, I decided to focus on my programming ability and success in school.  To this, I added some of the stuff I've done since then, including some Ruby, which I wasn't even exposed to in college.  At the end, I added the letters of recommendation I received from two of my professors at UT, including the one from the late Dr. Jesse H. Poore, a man I deeply respected and whom I now miss.  I also added a paper I wrote in my technical writing class, which (although it takes a bit to read) illustrates my writing ability and technical nous.

### It's pretty, but will it work?

That's something I haven't solved yet.  I've not had the chance to use it in an interview, but I see no reason why it wouldn't work.  Hiring managers are looking for four things, in ascending initial importance and descending _final_ importance:

1.  Enthusiasm -- do you love to walk the walk?
2.  Culture fit -- can you walk the walk with us?
3.  Trainability -- will you continue to learn how to walk the walk?
4.  Skills you already have -- can you walk the walk?

Item 4 will get you into the first interview.  Item 3 will become obvious to anyone who asks you about your reading list (you _have_ a reading list, right?) or what books you like.  (The "Sams Teach Yourself X in 24 Hours" books are not a valid answer to this question.)  Item 2 is apparent to your prospective future coworkers by how well you get on with them, and is supported by your answers in a behavioral interview.  That leaves item 1, which I'll discuss below.

An interviewer determines the answers to item 4 by looking at your resume and conducting the technical interview; these processes establish that you have a pulse, can at least perform the basics, and at least mostly match the person described on the resume.  She determines the answers to items 2, 3, and 4 by asking you questions and observing your response.  Why not provide a framework for structuring both her questions and your responses?  A work portfolio provides such a framework by giving you a foundation: you can explain the work, talk the interviewer(s) through it, and answer any questions they may have.  That's the goal of creating a portfolio -- and it's what I hope to have accomplished with mine.

### Appearance

If you've taken the time to create a cohesive personal brand appearance, it shouldn't be hard for you to make the portfolio fit in to that appearance.  I used Route 38 orange (`#EC7600`) for my name on the cover page, and I used the standard Route 38 typefaces throughout:

* Montserrat Subrayada for my name
* Montserrat for headings
* Alegreya for body text
* Source Code Pro for monospaced source text

In particular, the portfolio looks great with my personal business cards, which use the same combination of type.  They both look great in conjunction with <http://rt38.net> and <http://rt38.org>, which use the same general "appearance package."

### Contents

Here are the contents of the the portfolio I created for myself.

1. The [Vector3][ba-vector3] class from Bearded Axe.  For brevity, I removed a few operator overloads.  This shows off my skills with C++ and how they may be applied to a reusable module.
2. [My solution][pe-sol2] to problem 2 of Project Euler.  This demonstrates my grasp of sophisticated solutions to sophisticated problems.
3. [My safe_rm script][df-safe_rm] from my personal dotfiles.  This is a Ruby script that shows how I might use it as a supercharged shell scripting language.  Perl is the canonical language used here, but I like Ruby better.
4. The entry point to one of my school projects, a threaded server for multiuser chat.  This shows that I know how to handle error conditions and do multithreaded code.  All I'd need is to reacquaint myself with the basics of multithreading and probably read over the `pthreads` API.
5. An old shell script for generating stub source files from a header file definition.  I wrote this so I could write a header file and then create a C file for each function defined in it.  It worked well enough that I used it through the rest of college.
6. The entry point to another of my school projects, a question aggregator (for want of a better term).  The program accepted user input and appended to a log file, and it only used functions from a library I wrote.
7. The "[Bill Independent Linking Library][libbill]," which made it easier (read: less RSI-inducing) to perform certain repetitive tasks.  I included the main file from the library, which contains the functions to control debug logging and library init work.
8. A paper I wrote in my technical writing course that describes at a high level the inner workings of a compiler.  The paper earned an A and convinced me that I'm not as bad an explainer as I think.
9. The letters of recommendation written by two of my professors at UTK, rendered in the same Alegreya typeface as the rest of the portfolio, with only one "typo" (miscapitalization of "JavaScript") fixed.  I note above both letters that the originals (printed on UT letterhead) are available upon request to prove that I didn't write them via the colonic autoextraction methodology.

I created my portfolio using WordPerfect X6, which is nice because it's good and powerful but not as difficult to use (or as greedy of HDD space) as LaTeX.  You can use any word processor you like, and I'm sure you could even use LaTeX (and were I still in college, I'd try doing it!).
