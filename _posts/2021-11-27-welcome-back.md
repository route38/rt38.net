It's not usually my place to post about my life here on vsdev, and in
fact I have a whole 'nother blog where I do just that.  But the goals I
have here are big enough, and important enough, that they're getting a
treatment both here and at [Always Be
Chasing](https://alwaysbechasing.net), my lifestyle blog.  Without
further ado: some things I hope to accomplish in 2018.

## Mental reps: Reading, chess, new skills, and more exercise

I'm tired of not knowing jack crap about how to play chess.  I've had a
casual interest in the game my whole life and yet all I end up doing
when I approach a chessboard is getting checkmated in like six turns
against even a slightly competent player.  So one of my resolutions
heading into my thirtieth year is to finally learn, once and for all,
how to play chess at a decently respectable level.  I have no
pretensions about becoming the next Magnus Carlsen or Garry Kasparov,
but if I could hold my own against other amateurs of similar experience,
I'd be pleased.

To that end, I'll probably have to pursue some dead trees, which leads
to my next resolution: to read more, and to get back into reading
fiction for the first time since I was a teenager.  Some of the things I
hope to read about include:

0. Fiction
1. Business and careers
2. Self-development and psychology
3. Chess
4. Football and other sports
5. The outdoors
6. Gardening and turf care
7. Cooking
8. Crafting and creating
9. Technology
10. History
11. Sociology, social justice, and allied fields (e.g. women's studies,
    Queer studies, Africana studies, gender theory, etc.)
12. Politics
13. Writing (blogging, style, fiction, journaling, novels, etc.)
14. Music
15. Religion

That's a big list, and a long one, but it covers my bases.  I took a
course in Africana studies in college and despite the, eh, _quirks_ of
the course itself, I was generally interested in the content.  Likewise
with my sole sociology class -- and, indeed, my one academic regret that
pertains to my electives is that I did _not_ pursue any courses in
gender theory, women's studies, Queer studies (which I'm not even sure
UT offered any courses in at the time), or the other subdisciplines of
sociology dealing with identity.  I love to cook and I love getting my
hands dirty, so maybe I can start a little herb garden once I get an
apartment.  (Fresh parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme will be their own
rewards.  Ooh, and lots and lots of fresh cilantro!)

I also want to conquer a new skill or two, something I've never done
before.  Ballroom dancing jumps out for some reason, but only with the
right partner.  I'll figure that all out in due time, I suppose.

In the technical realm, I want to get more familiar with the use and
care of at least one of the BSD operating systems.

## Career change: Phase One

I want to get out of the jan-san industry and away from IT in one fell
swoop.  Before I elaborate further, let me state unequivocally that:

1. I always have, and always will, love computers and computing.

2. Despite No. 1 above, I have zero desire to turn computing into a
   career.

3. I also have no particularly strong desire to make a career out of
   cleaning.  I bear the industry no ill will, but it's just not my jam.

With those out of the way, here's what I do know, which is like two
things.

0. Cows go "moo."

1. I need to make more money.

2. I also need a career that I can be proud of, that I can start a
   business of my own in, and that I can transition into with only the
   bare minimum of re-education needed.

For the first of those (not the zeroth, mind), I'm currently working on
finding a job in the administrative sector, with particular emphasis on
back-office support work.  I recently completed an engagement at [The
Muse Knoxville](http://themuseknoxville.org), an interactive children's
museum in town that I urge any parents in East Tennessee currently
reading this to check out.  They're good folks at the Muse and I
consider myself blessed to have had the chance to work with them.
(Obligatory shout-out: Hi, Bicki, Stephanie, Andrea, Nancy, and Ellie!)  
In that engagement, I did pro bono essentially the kinds of work I wish
to do for pay in the workplace: filing documents, analyzing data in MS
Excel, preparing mailings, writing correspondence, purging stale
records, the whole bit.  Being privy to a conversation between that
organization's director and the accountant whose agency performs their
annual audits, I find myself interested in pursuing a career in
accounting or finance.  I'm not going in that direction completely
blindly: I took and greatly enjoyed two accounting courses in high
school, though like the dumbass you know and love, I failed to pursue the
matter in college.

## Step Two: On my own

The next major goal after finding work is moving into my own place.  I
love my parents and I am deeply grateful to them for having allowed me
to live with them for the seven years since I graduated from college.
That being said, as a man of almost thirty years old, I'm sick to death
of living with them and I yearn for the challenges and rewards of
self-sufficiency.  While getting my own place will cause enough
headaches that I should probably buy my stock in Novartis now (they of
Excedrin, one of the cosponsors of my college education alongside
Starbucks, Lenovo, and the Linux project) before hitting the rental
listings, the rewards will be legion.

## Step Three: Looking for my other half (in more ways than one)

For the first time since college, I'll be looking for something that
mere apartment lessee-hood and better employment won't be able to
fulfill: my need for companionship.  To that end, once my shit's more
fully in order, I'll be looking for a girlfriend and, eventually, for a
wife.  She will probably figure in the vsdev mythos at some point,
though how deep a role she plays is (a) up to her and (b) probably only
going to be a bit part for the first year or so.  (We're slow here at
vsdev.)  I'm ready for the challenges and rewards of being in a
relationship and I only hope, as I write this, that I find a partner
whom I believe to be as worthy of my time as she believes me to be of
hers.  I'll blog the details at ABC, but there are various reasons why
this will be difficult above and beyond the typical dating problems.

I'm also going to be building my circle of friends back up.  I've been
rather withdrawn for most of my twenties and my old circle of friends
has disappeared, mostly without a trace.

## In sum

You could boil down my goals for 2018 into four eminently manageable
pieces, each of which builds on the other.

1. Work
2. Home
3. Pals
4. Love

When I'm writing the Black Friday postmortem and bouncing post ideas off
of my girlfriend, waiting for my mates to show up at the apartment with
another couple of six-packs (and a bottle of wine for your humble
blogmaster), I'll know I've made it.  In my journal, I made a slightly
longer list:

0. Get a better job
1. Pay off my debts
2. Buy a new Mac
3. Get a physical
4. Get new eyeglasses
5. Get my teeth cleaned and start working on getting my teeth
   straightened
6. Seek therapy
7. Save up to move out, then do so
8. Find a girlfriend

In the interim, I can focus on all that other stuff.

Here's to a happy, prosperous, and most of all _successful_ 2018.
