I've decided that after 11 years of trying, there's just no room at anybody else's table for me to
break into the world of the tech industry.  As such, I've decided to take a familiar page from my
distant past.

I'm starting a company.  No blackjack, no hookers, just me finally getting paid to ply my trade as a
Web developer.  It only took me eleven fucking years to get to this point.

The firm's name is Dreamacy Digital Development.  More as it comes.  Fuck the job market, fuck
recruiters, and quintuple-somersault-fuck the people who go out of their way to tell me how unsuited
I am to sling code for them. üñïüèª

You had one chance.  Actually, check that - you had more than 700 chances.  I ain't givin' y'all
any more chances.  Y'all didn't do anything with the first 700, so why in the fuck do y'all think
I'm gonna give you any more?

I'm making my own way, and if you'd like to join me, reach out via the usual channels (email or
LinkedIn) to discuss what you want and whether/to what extent I can deliver.
