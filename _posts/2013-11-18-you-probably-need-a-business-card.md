Career blog _Careerealism_ posts in a recent post, ["Do I really need a business card?"][0]  Chances are, if you're a professional regardless of your field of endeavor, the answer is yes.  If you're out of a job, or are looking to escape the burger grill and get into what you're trained to do, you need all the help you can get in this hyper-competitive employer's market.  Remember, you have only seven seconds to make that first impression.  You've got the rest of the interview to reinforce it -- and at the end, a swell business card goes a long way.

Not stinking of mothballs, tobacco smoke and feces will go a long way toward ensuring that positive first impression -- but, alas, not far enough:

Sliding that business card across the table -- right-side up relative to the interviewer! -- at the end of the interview might just be the thing that seals the deal.  For the relative inexpense, it's worth a shot.

### Portraits and codes

The linked article suggests including a professional headshot if you've got one.  I don't have a professional headshot (and should probably find a portrait studio willing to do one on the cheap), but I do have somewhat of a design sense and can do halfway decently at making things pretty.  That's why, earlier this year, I made up a business card through [VistaPrint][1] and sent off for 250 of their basic business cards.  For less than $20, I got a card I could be proud of.

I eschewed clip art since it has that vibe of being from 1997, and I eschewed a photograph because I'm not an aspiring actor or model, and because a grainy cell phone photo would look like shit.  Vistaprint's templates look atrocious, so I didn't try one of those either.  What I did do was make up a simple design in Inkscape and add something nerdy: a QR code.  If you scan that code with your phone, you get something like [this Android screen dump][2].  Now that's pretty convenient, and more than that, it provides a point of conversation with the recipient; it might go something like this:

> Me: So, here's my card...
>
> Recipient: Ah, OK.  Is that a QR code?
>
> Me: Yes.  When you scan it, it'll add me to your phone's contact list, so you don't have to do it yourself.
>
> Recipient: Cool.  So are you interested in mobile marketing, app development, things of that sort?
>
> Me: Yes, I am; in fact, I just got my copy of _Programming Android_ and I'm looking forward to getting into it.  Ever since I first scanned one, I've always thought QR codes were super neat as well; I even built one into my _Minecraft_ world once...

I decided to include the code because I hate using my thumbs to do something my phone's camera is better at.

### Moving on...

The observant reader will notice that I have five icons on the card, with five pieces of information:

1.  Old-style phone handle: my telephone number, done through Google Voice for added convenience;

2.  Envelope: my email address, where I am always reachable;

3.  Twitter bird: my [Twitter handle][3], just waiting for you to follow;

4.  LinkedIn logo: my [LinkedIn][4] [vanity URL][4,5], just waiting for you to connect;

5.  Octocat: GitHub username[^note1], just waiting for you to fork.

I'm a little less than proud of how I set the icons and their caption text: notice that the text is not centered with respect to the icon, but that they instead share a baseline.  This is technically correct, I suppose, but it doesn't look very good in my opinion.  Outside of that, I'm thrilled with the result and I smile every time I look at my design.

### Colors and typefaces

First, a major irritation: [font and typeface are not interchangeable terms][5].  Read the linked article before you come back.

OK then.  Last time, I covered the [colors of the social media world][6].  At the very tail of that post, I listed the four colors for the 38verse, which is how I call the collection of sites I call my own.  In particular, those are <span style='color: #ec7600;'>Route 38 Orange</span>, <span style='color: #421a90'>Route 38 Purple</span>, <span style='color: #69901a'>Route 38 Chartreuse</span>, and <span style='color: #0076ec'>Route 38 Blue</span>.  This quartet of colors has several important attributes:

1.  It renders well on printed paper and in the browser.  This is, for obvious reasons, the prime consideration.

2.  It renders with sufficient contrast for colorblind users.  To test this, I used [this online service][7].  In particular, the primary combination of R38 Orange and R38 Purple isn't very distorted for red-green colorblind users.

3.  These four colors are roughly tetradic with respect to one another; R38 Purple and R38 Chartreuse are about 180&deg; apart on the color wheel as are R38 Orange and R38 Blue, and both R38 Orange/Purple and R38 Chartreuse/Blue are roughly the same distance from each other on the color wheel.  Playing with a color scheme designer reveals that the scheme is [roughly square][8] on the color wheel.

4.  Finally, I like all four of these colors.  Orange and red are my favorite colors of all and I find red a tricky color to design with, so using orange was a neat compromise.

With the color situation resolved, it became time to find typefaces.  Longtime readers remember that the very first iteration of this site used web-safe fonts like Helvetica and Georgia, which look all right but are ridiculously boring, rather like vanilla ice cream.  I flirted with a few other faces like Yanone Kaffeesatz and Caudex, the combination from my old blog formerly at 91revisions.com, before settling upon the now-standard combination of the Montserrat and Alegreya families.

I didn't optimize for traditional desktop displays; instead, I optimized for print and hence for retina displays, which were breaking 300 dpi when I started my branding efforts.  A quick glance at a Retina MacBook Pro at Best Buy confirms that the faces do indeed look as amazing on big retina displays as they do on smaller ones like my One X and Nexus 7.

#### Montserrat

Type designer Julieta Ulanovsky created three variants of [the spellbinding Montserrat][9] face: a standard sans-serif face evocative of old Buenos Aires (I use it on printed material), an alternate sans-serif with a more humanistic flair and more curves (_Montserrat Alternates_, I use it on the websites), and a stunning headline face with built-in underlines, called appropriately _Subrayada_[^note2] (I use it as the logotype for my name, mostly on printed material.)

To be honest, I prefer the alternate version to the standard face, because of its greater curvaceousness.

#### Alegreya

Type designer Juan Pablo del Peral, of _Huerta Tipogr&aacute;fica_ in Argentina, created Alegreya, which is a pleasing traditional serif face designed for body text.  Alegreya comes in a gorgeous roman, scintillating italic, and strong bold weight, plus an experimental and mind-blowing black weight.  There's also a hand-crafted small-caps variant that I occasionally use in printed matter; while it's very pretty, it's not worth the extra net traffic on this website.  You're looking at the roman and italic whenever you read a post at Route 38.  I also set my resume, business cards, and (on the rare occasion that I need one) printed cover letters in Alegreya.

#### Font Awesome

Finally, a special mention is due to Dave Gandy, maintainer of the [Font Awesome icon face][10].  Icon fonts are great for two reasons:

1.  They're as sparing of net resources as CSS sprites;

2.  They're infinitely scalable and hence look awesome on high-res displays and in print.

I use Font Awesome here at Route 38, for obvious reasons (check the site footer), and it doesn't look half bad on printed matter either -- so I use the icons on my resume.

### B-card Etiquette

Whilst business card etiquette is very particular [in Japan][11], it's not quite as fastidious in the US.  Still, though, there is a culture and etiquette associated with American business cards, and it boils down to three rules distilled here and [listed at Careerealism][12]:

1.  Don't hand out the card like Halloween candy; this makes you seem desperate and might just make you appear to be a frothing-at-the-mouth lunatic.  (Cue the bad '80s music and huge shoulder pads.)

2.  Give out cards only if people ask for them.  With enough swagger, you can give a card to someone whose want for it is implied, but this move isn't for the faint of heart.

3.  Only ask for cards if you intend to use them -- and then do so, even if you only send the card's owner a [thank-you note][13].

It's considered very bad form to write on the back of a Japanese business card, but it's more or less acceptable in the US and so you can use that space to jot down quick notes about the encounter.  In networking situations these days, I prefer to take a Moleskine journal with me (these are invariably black; I reserve brown for using at work) and jot the notes down there instead.  If you're hip enough, you could use Evernote or stash your notes in a private Git repos, but I'm not hip enough to carry an iPad or unhip enough to carry a netbook.  (I have given thought to the netbook, however...)

### Notes

[^note1]: The same advice holds for GitHub handles as for Twitter ones; in fact, if you can, I'd recommend making them one and the same as I have done.  Follow <http://r38.co/16LGuyb> for advice on Twitter handles.

[^note2]: _Subrayada_ simply means, "underlined," in Spanish.
