I'm starting a new exercise routine tomorrow and I plan to do it for 16
weeks.  The idea is to do things that will enable me to lean out faster
than mere dieting will allow me to accomplish.  This is a five-day plan
and it should make for interesting blogging if nothing else.

This plan is vaguely based on the _Starting Strength_ and _StrongLifts_
basic barbell plans and allows me to build strength, explosiveness, and
agility as well as torching fat.  On Mondays and Fridays, I do
conditioning work consisting of two rounds of HIIT followed by two sets
of dumbbell snatches and 15-20 minutes of LISS.  The HIIT, for now, is a
Real Basic Kinda Plan(tm) based on a more intense version of what I did
in middle school gym class: two rounds of sixty jumping jacks, twenty
burpees, and ten jump squats or jump lunges (my choice), with 1m30s rest
between rounds, followed by the dumbbell snatches.  For LISS, I'll
probably resort to the elliptical machine since it's low-impact, which
is important because I still weigh 102 kg.

For strength development, I spend three days a week lifting.  The lifts
are basic multi-joint compound moves; there's not exactly much trickery
here.

* Plan A: Go heavy or go home!
  * 5&times;5 back squat
  * 5&times;5 military press
  * 1&times;5+ deadlift
  * 3&times;10 lat pulldowns (single-hand, one set each hand)
  * 3&times;10 tricep pulldowns (rope handle preferred)
* Plan B: Chest out, shoulders back!
  * 5&times;5 back squat
  * 5&times;5 bench press
  * 5&times;5 bent row
  * 5&times;10 strict curl (back pad)
* Plan C: Be powerful!
  * 5&times;5 front squat
  * 6&times;3 power clean
  * 6&times;3 hang snatch
  * 3&times;30s timed holds

As I mentioned above, I will do this plan for 16 weeks and see where I
end up.  My goal is to accelerate my weight loss and get ever closer to
my goal body comp of 80 kg at 10-12% body fat.
