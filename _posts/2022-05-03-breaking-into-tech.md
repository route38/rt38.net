title: Breaking into tech is easier than ever.  Except when it isn't.

It's supposed to be easier than ever to establish a career in software
development.  So why is it that I'm having a harder time now than I did
10 years ago?

## The Situation

No, not [that guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sorrentino), he
of the bad fake tans and income tax evasion.

I've been trying to break into technology since 2011, at various points
submitting nearly 700 job applications to companies all over the United
States.  To that end, I've:

* Gotten a whole-ass CS degree
* Obtained a boot camp certification
* Spent thousands of hours on self-study
* Obtained three more certifications on my own time
* Built [some projects](//waellison.io/portfolio)
* Oh, and did I mention putting in almost 700 job applications?

## What I've Found

Lyft is putting on [an apprenticeship](https://archive.ph/H0VZh) for
people from nontraditional backgrounds.  Now, before I continue, I think
this is fantastic, and if I knew any coworkers in my decidedly
nontechnical day job who I thought might benefit, I'd be emailing them
the link.  As someone who comes from a hybrid technical/nontechnical
background, I feel like I'd be well-suited to such an opportunity,
perhaps even more so than the typical applicant.

That was until I scrolled about a fifth of the way down the page and saw
this: 

* **Candidates may not have a CS degree from a four-year university or
  significant CS industry experience.**

Well, fuck you too, Lyft.

## Why is this a bad thing?

I'm pretty proud of my computer science degree, as I feel I should be.
I put in a lot of work, I fought and scrapped and clawed, and I was
rewarded for my efforts with a body of knowledge, and a credential, that
nobody can take away from me.  I'm the first person in my family to go
to college, and although bashing higher education seems to be the vogue
thing these days, I still think it's important for people to do
_something_ after high school before they enter the workforce.

I've also been out of college for 11 years and I've never used my
degree for its intended purpose, which is to say that I've never written
a line of code for pay in my entire life.

I can't help but feel that excluding me, just because I happened to
listen to some CS lectures in my early twenties, only serves to make
people like me -- who might want to make their way back to the industry,
thereby giving themselves a second chance -- into some kind of pariah.
Nobody will hire me with just my boot camp background, and my degree is
now far enough in the rearview that nobody will hire me as a recent
graduate.  I don't have unlimited amounts of free time to pour into a
portfolio, I don't have an especially strong desire to solve
already-solved problems, and at the end of the day I just want a chance
to prove my skills in front of the right audience.  I don't have
anything public to demonstrate the time I've put in (which is my own
stupid fault, I'll admit), but I feel like I've already paid my dues by
getting a degree and putting in the untold thousands of hours of unpaid
practice.

An apprenticeship would be ideal for such an arrangement: I would be
able to work with the right people, on projects with real impact, in
such a way as to cater to my limited industry experience.

But if I'm too experienced for an apprenticeship or an internship, and
not experienced enough for an entry-level job (and I can't believe I'm
writing those words, since the whole idea of an entry-level position is
a role for someone with no relevant experience), my only alternative to
get the experience I need to break into the industry is to work for
myself.  And if I'm going to work for myself, then why wouldn't I just
do that instead of giving myself over to the corporate overlords?

To be fair, I think it's great that major tech companies are extending
their hands out toward people from non-traditional backgrounds.  It's
just that I feel that their methods are just a wee bit prejudicial
against those of us who _tried_ to go down the path set for us by our
parents and _failed miserably_ at capitalizing on the educations we
busted our asses to get.

Our backgrounds are non-traditional, too.  Just because the beginning
was ripped out of a textbook doesn't mean the middle or ending went
according to plan, and they sure as fuck didn't go according to plan for
me.

Next time, I promise I'll write about something less aggravating.

Maybe.

Toodles.
