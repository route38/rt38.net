[vsdev.org](//vsdev.org) is my main blog. I may be bringing up a
tech-centric blog, probably focusing on Linux and Ruby, at a new domain
TBD. Coming at the end of February is a blog about getting myself back
on track, called [Always Be Chasing](//alwaysbechasing.net). tnwae.us
(this site) will serve as a vanity page, status center, and online
resume.
