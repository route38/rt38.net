I sat down to begin penning this editorial in late December, and as I sat down to write one night, the music of Nirvana came crackling through my laptop's speakers.  None was more fitting a song to write to than "Smells Like Teen Spirit."  People argued grunge music was a fad, a passing trend, an interesting footnote to the history of popular music.  They were right, to an extent, but the influence of grunge cannot be denied on modern rock.  Just the same, when the first Palm Pilot came out in 1996, people decried the device as an expensive novelty, something useful only to the busiest of executives.  No ordinary person would possibly have the need for such a device, and nobody but a business tycoon had enough space in his briefcase to carry the clunky external modem.  That device directly presaged modern smartphones, though, and in that it was no more faddish than Nirvana albums or flannel shirts.

### The History

Cell phone technology hit critical mass with the advent of 2G service, which would form the backbone of modern personal communications.  2G phones were smaller, because their radios could be less powerful, and the reduced size made the phones both less complex and cheaper to manufacture.  The inevitable result was that cell phones would reach the masses, and soon they did.  Technology marched on, and the BlackBerry device family introduced businesspeople of all stripes to the joys of having instant access to email and messaging on a pocketable device.

Then a little company in California challenged the status quo, daring to release a phone without a physical keyboard.  It was called iPhone, and people loved it.  I suspect there were three primary reasons people loved the first generation of iPhone, with a fourth thrown in for good measure:

0. You could use it as an iPod with a cell modem in it, and it synced with iTunes.

1. You could browse the "real web" with it, rather than needing a crappy WAP browser.

2. It did email and SMS as well as a BlackBerry, but it wasn't the unhip device that RIM had been churning out en masse.

3. (Related to reason zero above) Because it synced with iTunes, it "just worked" with Macs, which are (no arguments please) the epitome of "just works."[^1]

Apple is now a device manufacturer that happens to make computers; even before iPhone, the Macintosh business was incidental to Apple's iPod sales.  Regardless, the significant innovation of an all-touch smartphone led to the eventual displacement of hard keyboards in the phone market, and two primary competitors emerged: Apple, represented by iOS on its own devices, and Google, represented by Android on a panoply of devices by HTC, Huawei, Samsung, LG, and others.

We've moved on to the fourth generation of wireless telecommunication, and 4G has brought with it the sort of bandwidth we associated just a few years ago with desktop PCs connected to the cable network.  Modern smartphones are as powerful as low-spec laptops from just a couple of years ago, and but for their small size I suspect they could make a capable replacement for a laptop for a lot of people.

Let that sink in: in 2014, your smartphone -- even if it's on the older side -- is about half as powerful as your laptop from 2006, and I suspect you could still access Google Drive with the old laptop.  (If it's beefy enough, it could run a modern version of Windows.)  We are rapidly approaching an age where phones and laptops are roughly on power parity with each other, and low-end laptops are already on an even footing with tablets.

### Realities

I'm going to pick on tablets for a bit, because I know why phones are so popular, and it's easier to dissect.  But tablets seem harder for people to grok, so I'm going to dissect why they're so popular.

#### Zero configuration

Imagine a device that you never had to consciously update.  This hypothetical device would keep itself and its installed applications up to date without user intervention, freeing you up to worry about important things like the kids' soccer practice and paying bills.  Said device would also integrate itself into your online life, so you can easily upload photos of your dog to Facebook and tweet every time your kid scores a touchdown.  Finally, this entirely hypothetical device would get hours of battery life at a stretch -- twelve or so hours of use, and more if you don't watch YouTube or play _Candy Crush Saga_.

That device isn't hypothetical: it's an iPad or Nexus 10 or any other tablet out there.  The debut of the tablet PC running a mobile operating system, a template established by the first Android tablets and cemented by iPad, established the modern model of the easy-to-use computer with a low learning curve, automatic updates, and a significant focus on the internet.  Tablets make it easier to do many of the things that, just a few years ago, we did on laptops or desktops:

* Gaming (just look in the Play Store or App Store)

* Browsing the internet (Mobile Safari, Google Chrome)

* Viewing multimedia, whether by streaming (e.g. YouTube, Netflix, Hulu) or by uploading it to the device

* Listening to music (iTunes Radio, Google Play Music)

* Social networking (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn)

Indeed, tablets are at their heart internet devices, and as such they don't require much in the way of configuration.  All you have to do is point it at your wireless network, and if you use LTE service you don't even need to do that, just install a SIM card or tie the CDMA device to your cell provider's plan.  When your device begs you to update, you update, which typically requires a reboot.  If you own an iPad, you plug it into your computer to sync up music and video, and to update apps.  (iOS 7 finally has automatic app updates.)

It takes a lot less effort than running a PC, and that's a good thing for most people: it connects them to the tasks they enjoy, and "real productivity" is left to the device that does it best: a PC.  I think the clear delineation between "productive devices" and "mobile devices," which is only blurred by laptops, is here to stay at least for some users.

### Hard and soft

In fact, the distinction between hard and soft computing, which varies depending on who makes the distinction, is one of the arguments anti-mobile people bring up when confronted with the significant reality that tablets and phones are the future of computing for the mass market.  Hard tasks include:

* CAD, CAM, and visualization

* GIS

* Software development

* Video and audio editing, as for a film studio or TV network

* Number-crunching and huge spreadsheets, as in corporate finance, stock trading, and allied fields

* Scientific calculations

* Data mining and the larger field of BI

* Hardcore gaming

Softer tasks include everything I listed in the prior section, plus word processing on larger tablets.  The prevalence of Bluetooth keyboards for all sorts of tablets has led to a significant minority of writers relying upon tablets as their sole productivity devices.  The same could be said of the Microsoft Surface tablet, which comes with a dockable keyboard.  So what is it about these hard tasks that relegates them to powerful laptops or even full-blown desktops?  I volunteer four things, primarily:

0. The requirement for multiple displays

1. The requirement for massively parallel computing, such as through a compute grid or GPGPU

2. The requirement for more electrical power than a mobile device can muster

3. (Related to reason 1 above) The requirement for advanced graphical processing

As it stands, tablets can't currently do any of these things.  Some tablets have a Mini DisplayPort or mini-HDMI port that can accept a second monitor; this is most common on Windows tablets.  You surely wouldn't do anything so intense on an iPad or even a Nexus.

The analogy I plan on using to drive this home comes from the world of diesel engines.  You can buy a car with a small-displacement 4- or 5-cylinder diesel engine, smaller than a couple of liters, and experience greater efficiency than you would with a petrol engine.  The diesel engine revs more slowly, uses less fuel, and operates at a higher compression ratio, meaning the combustion cycle is more efficient.  The tradeoff is that diesel exhaust stinks even worse than petrol exhaust.  The other important problem is that while diesel engines have lots and lots of torque, they're fairly lacking in terms of horsepower.  (To use a tired analogy: horsepower is how fast you're going when you hit the wall; torque is how far it moves when you hit it.)

You can also have built a custom-made diesel powerplant with a displacement measured in the hundreds of liters for your locomotive, ferry, or supertanker.  The diesel-electric locomotive, in fact, is the standard fixture on today's railways, owing to its efficiency.  CSX, in fact, claim that one of their locomotives can carry a ton of freight (about 900 kg) on one gallon of diesel (3.75 L) for about 420 miles (675 km).  Of course, trains weigh in the thousands of tons, and they consume diesel by the thousands of liters.  If you want to move a lot of stuff very quickly, a train is your best bet.  Just the same, if you need to do a lot of computation, a 6- or 8-core desktop (possibly even a 12- or 16-core if it's dual-processor) is what you want, not a low-power dual- or quad-core tablet.  Tablets are great for the kind of computing they were made for.  No tablet manufacturer ever has claimed that theirs is the best tablet for processing terabytes of data, having insanely fast storage, or being top-spec in any fashion -- except in relation to other tablets.

### For enthusiasts only!

Nobody is suggesting, even for a second, that the computer as we knew in 2000 will die off completely.  I anticipate that the traditional desktop paradigm will become to computing what "simple" cars are to the world of driving: machines for enthusiasts.  You can buy a car today without power steering, anti-lock brakes, traction control, automatic shifting, or even power brakes or power clutch.  It's probably a racing car, or damn near it, like a Lotus or TVR, both enthusiast brands for the serious driver.  Just the same, not so long from now -- give it ten years, perhaps -- and you'll be able to go to a computer store, or to an online storefront, and buy a traditional computer with a monitor, mouse, keyboard, printer, expansion slots, the whole bit.  Chances are, however, that unless you genuinely need the power, capabilities, or traditional interface, that you won't opt for one.  Hell, I'd argue that day is almost here in early 2014.  The lines have already been blurred: you can buy touch laptops, dockable tablets, Bluetooth keyboard cases, and more items that turn laptops into tablets and tablets into laptops.  That I considered, even for a brief instant, using a tablet as a production device is a testament to how far the notion has come in the nearly four years since iPad changed the tablet PC landscape in 2010.[^2]

In 2044, I will still be using a mouse and keyboard.  Part of the reason why is that I have been using a mouse and keyboard for the past 20 years; it is the best way I know to interact with a computer.  I appreciate and truly adore the power and efficacy of the traditional WIMP paradigm as well as the stronger and more-concise environment of the command line.  Command shells have been around since the '60s and have never died completely -- to wit, you can go to the App Store on your iPad or the Play Store on your Nexus and download a Secure Shell client (iSSH being the one I liked on my iPod touch, and JuiceSSH being a good replacement on my Nexus), and then you can party like it's 1979.

But, when I am 56 in 2044, I'll also still be using touch.  The directness of touch is the single greatest attribute that the mode of interaction has.  We found that out in 2007 with the original iPhone, and we found it out again in 2010 with the original iPad.  Even Nintendo got in on the action: chances are, if you're reading this, that you have a Nintendo DS or 3DS laying around your house.  After all, to quote from Nintendo themselves, touching is good.

### Mobile is really, really here to stay

The immediacy of mobile devices -- fish it out of your pocket, execute your search query, and get your results -- combined with the continued evolution of wireless networks ensures that the mobile device is most definitely here to stay.  It falls to us as Web developers to use the power we have been given in responsible, ethical, and technically sound ways to make lives better through technology.  Ours is the mantle that desktop developers had twenty years ago, and that mainframers had twenty years before that.  One could argue, as I might later this year, that ours is the most difficult job in technology, since it represents for the first time in human history a technology that can be disseminated immediately and used by billions -- yes, Carl Sagan _billions_ -- of users, also immediately.  The barrier of entry is growing increasingly high, which some see as backsliding and others see, as I do, as the price of admission.

Is it elitist to see Web technology, in all its myriad forms, as a gated community?  Perhaps.  I care not.  Ours seems like an easy trade, but it isn't.  We release to millions of users, who are as fickle as it gets.  One false move and you lose users.  Losing users means losing money.  Losing money means losing your business.  Yahoo should prove an easy and illustrative example.  They are a company struggling in 2014 to sell the same business model they promoted in 2004.  They struggle for relevance in the same way horse carriage manufacturers struggled for relevance when the automobile hit critical mass.  Companies like Google and Facebook are able to adapt with the agility needed in today's technology market.  Falter at adapting, and just like in nature, you are left to die.

So mobile is definitely here to stay, and it means that our already infamously cutthroat industry is even more difficult to compete in.  The expectations are greater, the risks are greater, the average user is more discerning, the experts are even more adept, and audiences grow with $100 phones instead of $1000 laptops.  If this is a fad, then it's the biggest fad in human history.

[^1]: Except when they're not.  The only industry bigger than selling Macs is working on Macs.

[^2]: For what it's worth, I considered a Microsoft Surface with a Type Cover.  For just about $350 more, I bought a real laptop, with a quad-core processor (and a hyper-threaded one at that) and computing power to shame my old desktop.
