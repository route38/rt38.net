A four-day weekend draws to a close, and as I sit here enjoying the silence
on this Sunday night, I've been thinking a lot about training lately.  It
seems that we in the computing field can't decide how is the best way to
make sure that someone has the skills they claim to, that they can put those
skills to use on real codebases, and that they are even learning the right
things to begin with.  As someone with the rare combination of a CS degree,
a boot camp certification, and experience in training outside of the industry,
I feel that I am ideally positioned to examine this issue from all sides.
To this end, I am going to examine the four paths that most commonly lead to
the discipline of software development, where they go wrong, and what they
do right.  Fair warning: this is going to be one of my long posts.

The path to software development careers is widely considered to be threefold,
but I am going to split out one of the paths as I feel it appropriate to
look at every possible facet of the issue of how developers earn their talents
and what that means for their ability to get paying work in the field.  The
four paths are:

1. University education (culminating in a bachelor's degree)

2. Some other postsecondary schooling (vocational school or junior college)

3. Boot camps

4. Self-study

Though not in computer programming, I have experience with a vocational
school; I also have a boot camp certification and a college degree.  Moreover,
I have engaged in no small amount of self-study over the years.  So, let's
look at each training style, its benefits, its drawbacks, and what I feel
it could do better.

## University: Just learn everything, aight?

August 18, 2006, ranks among the best days of my life.  That was the day, you
see, when I enrolled as a wide-eyed undergrad at the University of Tennessee.
I moved out on my own into a dormitory, I had to hold myself 100% accountable
for my success or failure, and I found this level of responsibility to be
empowering.  I greatly enjoyed my time as a freshman and given the choice of a
month to relive in my life, the period from August 18 to September 18, 2006,
would be my choice every time.

College wasn't easy for me after that first semester or so, however: I switched
from a liberal arts program (specifically in French literature) to computer
science, and I often felt lost, confused, alienated, and above all else, lonely
as a collegian.  I failed to form genuine connections with my classmates and
found it hard, even in a degree program full of kindred spirits, to fit in.
I didn't have real friendships, I didn't date, and I didn't get involved in
extracurricular activities or internships.  I spent my summers, rather, on
helping my family build their business.  I never took advantage (until it was
too late) of the facilities my university offered to help its graduates find
jobs, and most damningly of all, I recall submitting exactly one application
to an internship.  (They declined to interview me.  For an internship!)

What I encountered after I graduated was more of the same.  Companies in 2011
refused to hire me for internships, since I had my degree (and at the time,
internships were exclusively for people who were still enrolled in class), but
I couldn't get through the hiring process partly due to my lack of experience
(which required absurd amounts of spin on resumes of the era) and partly due to
my own pig-headedness once I got in interviews.  To put it plainly, I was
convinced I was right, that everyone else was wrong, and I didn't have anyone
aside from my family (who I ignored just like I ignored everyone else) to tell
me what I was doing wrong.

Between September 2010 (about eight months before graduation) and December 2015,
I estimate that I submitted more than 750 job applications, attended more than
60 interviews, and got one offer, which was rescinded before I could fax back
the signed offer letter.  The hellscape of my dreams was no release from my
waking nightmare.  I dreamed of death.  I fantasized about faking my own death
and leaving for parts unknown.  I wished for my own end to come about
prematurely.  The depression I went through well and truly posed an existential
threat to my life.  Only by repudiating the technical part of my life,
completely blocking it from my conscious mind, could I start to heal.  I did
just this in 2018 (more on that in the next section).

With that all in mind, what does college get right?  What does it get wrong?
Where does it need to improve?

### University Pros

- _Heavy emphasis on theory means that you will learn the "why" in addition to
  the "what."_
  
  This makes it a lot easier to learn other languages, frameworks, and systems.
  Moreover, ideas might come to you that wouldn't necessarily come to you
  absent a less theoretical background (like the glut of transpilers currently
  littering the webdev landscape).

- _Liberal-arts and distribution requirements make you a more rounded person._
  
  There were three components of my comp sci program that set it apart from any
  boot camp or other program, and none of them came in a computer science
  class.  Of the three most important courses I took in college, only _one_ of
  them was a course in my major (COSC 340, Software Engineering).  The other
  two were COMM 240 "Business and Professional Communication" and ENGL 360
  "Technical Writing."  You are reading (part of) the result of both of those
  courses, and moreover these courses have in common that they teach you
  how to communicate.  MUCO 110 "A History of Rock &amp; Roll" was a
  distribution requirement and, for the only time in my academic life, a
  course where listening to Marvin Gaye was a course requirement, which was
  its own reward.

- _Some people care about where you got your degree._
  
  And this doesn't just go for schools like Stanford, MIT, Berkeley, etc.,
  whose reputations largely precede them.  The guy or gal who hires you,
  who selects you over thousands of other applicants, might just take a liking
  to you because you went to Big State U just like they did.

  Graduating supposedly affords you access to the school's alumni association,
  though if UT's is a dues-collecting organization then I've never paid dues
  and, in any case, I've never had any great desire to interact with someone
  just because we both happen to know that the Big Orange Screw&trade; is kept
  at Andy Holt Tower.

### University Cons

- _It takes a while._
  
  It took me five years to finish college.  That extra year didn't cost me
  anything, since most of my financial aid covered all five years of
  enrollment.  My mental state was such that I scraped by with low course
  loads for the majority of my time at UT, and being stuck there another
  year did my mental health no favors.  It's a substantial time investment
  and one that no person should make lightly.

- _It's (probably) expensive._

  The American federal government, the Tennessee state government, and the
  university itself paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $80,000 for me to
  attend college for five years, including three years of living on-campus.
  That was in-state tuition at the University of Tennessee, and at that it
  was the cost for me to attend school as a commuter student for whom
  college was a drive across town.  Most of my college friends were from
  other parts of Tennessee or from elsewhere in the country; I was the only
  Knoxville boy I knew.

- _What you learn in college isn't (necessarily) what you'll really use._

  I learned _very_ early in my job search that trying to get on as a
  firmware engineer or some other big-brain type of role, with no experience
  or even portfolio projects to show what I could do at such a low level,
  was a recipe for getting my resume chucked in the paper shredder.  C and
  C++ are amazing languages, and to this day C is my favorite programming
  language ever devised by the hand of Man (yes, besting even Python),
  but it's not a common thing to need to know in the industry.  My program
  did teach Java in the upper-division courses, after exposure to the
  brain-melting complexity of C++, but the language was unevenly used between
  courses and different instructors had different language preferences.
  I took a GUI course that taught the Swing API (as opposed to a Web
  framework or, I dunno, _not fucking Swing_!) and then followed that up
  with a graphics course taught in raw OpenGL and plain C.

  In both cases, what I learned was outdated even as the professor was
  lecturing on it.

- _You're (mostly) on your own if your institution has a bad career services
  department._

  This is self-explanatory: UT's idea of career services was to open up an
  optional job fair to students and recent alumni, where you'd go around and
  hand your resume to any warm body willing to take a look at it.  I did get
  interviews this way, because it's hard to tell a guy no to his face when he's
  willing to wear a business suit and walk around a sweaty ballroom looking for
  anyone willing to hear his crappy elevator pitch.  However, and I'll get to
  this in a couple of bullet points, the university could have done a lot
  better.

### University Points of Improvement

- _Updated curriculum (broadly) reflecting industry trends._

  Our webdev course (and yes, I did take it) taught HTML/CSS, raw JavaScript,
  Perl, MySQL, and PHP.  No Ruby, no Mongo, no Postgres, no Python, no
  jQuery, no AJAX.  (Hey, it was 11 years ago.  React wasn't a thing yet.
  AngularJS was barely a thing.  Flask was barely a thing.  Django was
  mature tech and so was Rails, however!)  In 2010, practically nobody
  used Perl for webdev, and that's all the more pronounced now.

  Other notable omissions from my program: anything Microsoft-related,
  significant exposure to databases, significant exposure to modern OpenGL
  development (* in my graphics elective), and (arguably) significant work
  with multiprocessing.  Is it any surprise that (aside from databases)
  these remain major gaps in my knowledge?

- _Every CS alum knows a scripting language or three._
  
  What do Bash, Python, JavaScript, and Ruby have in common?  Aside from all
  being excellent languages, they're all three used for pretty goodly amounts
  of automation -- I can and have used shell scripts to automate many, *many*
  tasks on Linux, and my main motivation for learning Ruby years ago, and
  JavaScript more recently, was to use them for automation -- system scripting
  and Rake in the case of Ruby and Gulp in the case of JavaScript.

  If I ran a CS department, every alumnus exiting my program would know Bash,
  Python, and JavaScript in addition to C, C++, and Java.

- _Career services with some actual muscle._

  This would, in my ideal world, start even before freshman year with exploring
  potential majors, and internships -- arranged through the university -- would
  be a requirement of all juniors and seniors (and yes, that would have meant
  I'd have taken three internships since I was a fifth-year senior).  All
  graduating seniors would be required to take an exit course on interviewing,
  job searching, networking, and how to function in an office, and students
  passing that course would be referred to recruiters who would help place them
  in their desired industries.

  This would require universities to acknowledge their roles as de-facto
  training centers for the white-collar workforce, meaning that I don't see
  this happening anytime soon for the majority of universities.

## Trade schools and community colleges: get in, get trained, get out

I had to leave tech behind entirely in order to heal from the mental wounds
inflicted by a protracted job search that dragged into its sixth year before I
called it off.  I lived in a constant state of profound depression, only doing
the barest of bare minimums to get by.  One night, fortuitously, I was looking
through the want ads.  I'm not sure why the word _coder_ stuck in my mind so
prominently -- I have never seen a job for a developer listed as a coder,
notwithstanding that coding is a significant part of what a software developer
does.  But I saw an opening for a medical coder, and I clicked on it to see
what it was all about.  To be honest, it sounded fascinating in a way I can't
fully explain despite having worked in the business for 3&frac12; years now.

The job of a _medical coder_ is deceptively simple: to read a medical record
made by a physician or other medical provider, discern what illnesses were
treated and what procedures were performed, and record specific codes
describing those diagnoses and procedures so that they can be reported to
insurance companies.  It's not the sort of thing you'd really want to learn
on the job, but neither is it something so complicated that you have to go and
get a four-year degree for it.  For many coding jobs, work experience and an
industry certification are enough to get your foot in the door for an
interview.

As you may have figured out by now, I live in the state of Tennessee.  One
great thing we have in Tennessee, alongside all the others, is our state-run
college scholarship and grant program, funded by the Tennessee Education
Lottery and also, more recently, by fees collected by the state for sportsbooks
to operate within the state's borders.  (I once made $90 on a five-game parlay
during baseball season, a success I have yet to replicate as a sports bettor.)
If you qualify for the Pell Grant, as I did when I went to UT, and if you can
get some merit-based scholarships (whether athletic or academic), then you
can -- if you are judicious about your choice of institution -- attend college
in Tennessee debt-free, if you are a resident prior to your eighteenth
birthday.

For adult learners, however, even those with bachelor's degrees, there is
another option.  If you can afford your books and supplies, then the state
will [pay for you to attend one of the many Tennessee Colleges of Applied
Technology][tcat-reconnect] scattered around our state.  So, for a total
outlay of about $800 (counting the cost of meals, gas, brake shoes for my
car, uniforms, graduation supplies, and textbooks), I was able to retrain as
a medical biller and coder.  The state picked up the remaining $4,000 that it
would've taken for me to enroll.

I started class on May 1, 2018, and I had a job offer in hand on August 24 --
at a firm where I work to this day.

### Trade School Pros

- _Doesn't take long._
  
  The longest programs offered by my local TCAT are in computer technician,
  diesel mechanic, and allied health: the programs for dental assisting,
  medical assisting, and LPN are one year long while computer tech is 5
  trimesters and diesel mechanic is 6 trimesters.  That's still a damn sight
  shorter than a university degree.
  
- _Trains you exactly as you need to be trained._
  
  The skills you learn during your time as a TCATter are immediately
  transferable to the job: aside from the specifics of one computer program
  I learned, I use everything I learned in my program on a regular basis.

- _Establishes a routine._
  
  This sounds basic, and it is, but going to TCAT every day -- getting
  dressed in my red and black medical scrubs, driving over to campus, spending
  the day working, taking my lunch at 11:00 and leaving campus at 14:30 every
  afternoon -- imposed a routine on my life that was badly needed after the
  profound depression of the previous couple of years.

- _Instructors have industry experience._
  
  My medical office instructor was an older lady who had significant experience
  both as a teacher of the discipline and as a worker within the industry,
  having worked in medical offices for more than 15 years and having taught
  her course for almost 20 when I finished it.  When you go to a vocational
  school, you're being taught how to do the work by people who've actually done
  the work -- not by professional academics who are there to do research.

- _Excellent career support._
  
  TCAT Knoxville requires (at least in the medical office course) a five-week
  externship at the conclusion of the classroom portion of the program.  This
  is work in a real medical office done in exchange for course credit.  I
  was encouraged to apply for a role in the office where I got my externship,
  and on my last day as an extern, UPA extended me a job offer.  I celebrated
  my third anniversary on UPA's payroll in September.  It's hard to compete
  with results like that: _TCAT puts Tennesseans to work, simple as that._

### Trade School Cons

- _The scope of the training is narrow._
  
  This isn't really a valid complaint for the true target audience of a
  vocational school: the LPN student attends because he wants to be a practical
  nurse; the diesel engine student attends because she wants to work on diesel
  engines; the truck driving student attends because they want to drive trucks.
  Even for the aspiring medical biller, you're likelier to get ahead in most
  billing offices with experience and certifications than with a degree -- I am
  one of only a handful of people at my current employer with a college degree.
  However, the scope of the training is intentionally narrow, and in all
  likelihood a diesel mechanic will learn more about running his own garage
  just by working in a garage than he ever would in a classroom, and I can
  guarantee he'll learn more about being part of a team of other mechanics from
  shop time, whether at school or as an apprentice, than from some abstract
  presentation.
  
  Vocational schools have one goal in mind: getting their alumni-to-be
  job-ready. Anything that distracts from that goal is extraneous to the
  program, _by design_.

- _Programming courses aren't usually offered._
  
  This may or may not apply in your locale, but software development is not
  offered at my local TCAT.  The computer technician program available provides
  training for some CompTIA and Microsoft certifications and basically trains
  the would-be graduate to work in an IT department. My only concern in that
  regard is that some might take that course expecting to be taught how to
  program, only to emerge bitterly disappointed (if they even complete the
  course).

- _You still have to buy your own equipment._
  
  For the medical office program, this was no big deal, just $400 in books
  and scrubs.  For someone who wants to take the welding program, or one of the
  other programs with a lot of tools involved, this can get pricey in a hurry.

### Trade School Points of Improvement

There isn't really anything that the average trade school could do to
"improve" itself without sacrificing the purity of purpose on which the very
model of vocational instruction is built.  Offering programming courses in
a boot-camp-similar model

## A deeper dive -- next time

This post ran appreciably longer than I expected it to, even given its
impressive breadth.  Next time, I want to delve into boot camps and the
self-teaching model, and in a third post, I want to tie everything
together by suggesting ways that aspiring developers, universities, and
industry can come together to keep the pipeline full of rising talent.

Be excellent to each other.
