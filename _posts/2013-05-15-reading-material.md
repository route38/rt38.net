So I've been book shopping again.  I got four books at the bookseller's today, and I'm looking forward to all four of them.

* *Cocoa Programming for Mac OS X* by Aaron Hillegass and Adam Preble is **the** resource for the Objective-C language, the Cocoa platform, and the Macintosh and iOS environments.  The fourth edition, unbelievably, was current at the time of purchase and cost a tidy $25.  I don't have much positive to say about Apple the consumer electronics company, but Apple the computer company is still all right.

* *The Dictionary of Corporate Bullshit* by Lois Beckwith is a funny (and sadly true) account of the bullshit spewed forth by corporate America.  Definitely worth a read.

* I'm sick and tired of traditional job hunting, and so is professional career coach Orville Pierson, who has devised a twelve-step method for finding work without the hassle of actually finding work.  *The Unwritten Rules of the Highly Effective Job Search* is the name of the book, and I'm hopeful that it actually does what it says it will: help me more effectively look for work.

* Finally, *Being Geek* bills itself as "the Software Developer's Career Handbook," and I'm hoping it actually will be such.  The chapters are brief and although the headings are in Myriad, that's a typical stylistic choice for an O'Reilly book, of which I own several new and used.

My goal is to find a web developer job and do it for a few years so I can get enough experience to start my own company.  I don't want to go headlong into freelancing without some idea of what to expect as a freelance Web designer and developer.

Also, a new job will help me be able to afford a new Mac.  Can't argue with that!  I'm drooling over a Retina MacBook Pro, but I can't afford one and I'm holding off until 10.9 anyway.
