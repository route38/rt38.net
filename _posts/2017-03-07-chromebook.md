So I purchased myself a new laptop on 3 March.  Meet my Chromebook
Pixel, one of the few laptops you can still find with integrated 4G LTE
support.  The LTE support was only one reason why I decided to buy a
2013 laptop to replace my other 2013 laptop, of course; the 239 ppi
display should prove to be its own reward.

I've christened this laptop Annapurna, after the massif in Nepal, whose
highest peak boasts the most difficult ascent in the sport of
mountaineering.  The highest peak of the massif, Annapurna I Main, is
8,091 meters above sea level, tenth highest in the world.  This laptop
supersedes both Elbrus and Sagarmatha as my primary portable.
