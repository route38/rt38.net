There's not much to see here.  My photography blog,
[Between the Sprocket Holes][btsh], will be coming up in full soon.
I'll be discussing film photography, cameras, great photographs of the
past, and and occasionally some more offbeat stuff like the best music
to listen to in the darkroom.  Check it out at the link.

I've made some progress on renovating my studio area in my bedroom, so
I'll be ready here in a bit to use Denali for its intended purpose of a
development workstation.  I'm torn between Arch Linux and Debian as
a development OS, though my computer has a very chic Debian logo sticker
on the front.  In either case, I'll be using the King's desktop
environment, KDE.

I'm excited by the picks the Broncos made in the NFL Draft.  I'm anxious
to give Garett Bolles the benefit of the doubt, and I'm anxious to get
my Jake Butt jersey even if I'm not a Wolverines fan.

I'm less excited by the actions of certain citizens of the Nation -- Red
Sox Nation, that is.  That racist asshole from a couple nights ago at
Fenway makes me ashamed to be a Sox fan.
