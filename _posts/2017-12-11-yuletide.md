It's the holiday season, which means that it's the most nerve-wracking
time of the year.  Truthfully, not much has changed around here.

Some of the goings-on around these parts include:

* I'm still looking for work.  My hypertext resume is due for an update. 

* I'm amped about the recent hire of Jeremy Pruitt at UTK.  Coach Pruitt
  is exactly what we need in Vol Nation.  GBO.

* The Broncos won, somehow, and squandered their chance at a good draft
  pick.  (The Jets suck, explaining the Broncos' victory.)

* I've gotten into the music of Steely Dan and count _Aja_ among my
  favorite albums ever pressed.

Until next time, my friends.
