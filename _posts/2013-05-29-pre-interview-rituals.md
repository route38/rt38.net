Whenever I prepare for a job interview, I have a certain set of rituals I go through to prepare myself both mentally and physically for the upcoming challenge. In the vein of [this post at Careerealism][1], here are the things I do. Some of these are conventional; others, not so much.

1.  Shine my shoes. This simple task clears my mind of any flotsam and lets me think only about shining my shoes and nothing else. If I've shined them in the past month, I'll just buff them a bit and brush them off, but with the same amount of care and attention that I'd use were I actually shining them. Shining your shoes makes them look their best and shows you pay attention to detail. I also use this opportunity to pair dress shoes and dress socks. Black with black, obviously.

2.  Press my shirt. Again, I'm redirecting my anxious energy by focusing it on a simple task. I don't press my own suit jacket or trousers -- both tasks better left to your dry cleaner -- but I do press my own shirts, something every man should know how to do. At this point, I pick my shirt and tie, based on which suit I'm wearing.  I have four suits, two of which are suitable for interviewing (one doesn't fit for shit and is a flashy black suit, and the other is a little too informal) -- a slightly baggy gray one and a more fitted navy pinstripe job.

3.  Hang my suit and trousers out in my room. Getting the garments out of my closet lets them assume their natural hang -- especially important with wool suits -- and it's good to let air circulate around the garments as well.

4.  List questions I wish to ask. Now we're focusing sharply on the task at hand. I favor pen and paper because I'm more traditional and the paper will accompany me to the interview, but of late I find Evernote increasingly convenient and friendly. I still copy to paper, though.

5.  Print out a couple of [interview note sheets][2] and a few copies of the resume submitted in consideration of the position. The note sheet is a big deal because it lets me list the time/date, location, company, and interviewer -- all big details to remember. If there are multiple interviewers, I'm careful to write the names of each one.

6.  Replenish my business card carrier, if needed. I ordered 250 cards from Vistaprint and I always make sure to stick my card carrier in my jacket pocket, as that means I'm in networking mode.

7.  Prepare my "fiddly folder," which contains the aforesaid note sheets, resumes, and other documents (I keep a couple of letters of recommendation written by former professors) and extra blank paper. If I'm in newsy mood (which doesn't happen often), I'll print out and stick in a couple of topical news articles or blog posts. Nowadays, it's easier for me to take my tablet along instead.

9.  Review my lists of professional accomplishments. I maintain two such lists, one describing tasks I completed and another explicitly describing projects from college. I'm just a couple of years out (has it really been that long?), so what I did in school is still fair game.

10. Actually get ready for the thing. This includes:
    * Gas in the car, especially if it's halfway across town. Duh.

    * Shower, shave, teeth brushed, (a tiny) dab of cologne on each wrist, shoes polished and shined, suspenders put on correctly, and gig line perfectly straight.

    * Windsor tie knot. My favorite interviewing shirt has a spread collar and the Windsor is a thick, triangular knot perfect for projecting confidence and looking like you mean business.

    * Clean eyeglasses. I have oily skin, so it's harder to keep my glasses clean, and when I clean them with soapy water, it's like putting on a pair fresh from the optician.
      
11. Go and piss excellence. Notes:
    * Don't drive in a suit jacket.

    * If you're afraid you'll go careening off the road, don't drive in your dress shoes, and find better dress shoes.

    * Wear comfortable shoes. I feel this is especially important advice to give to women, but both sexes tend to sacrifice comfort for appearance.
    
    * When I arrive, I always make sure to arrive a few minutes earlier than some may suggest, because I'll inevitably spend some of those minutes in the bathroom doing my business and freshening up.

A couple of notes about tie knots, a strangely nerdy subject:

* There are, mathematically, eighty-five ways to tie a standard necktie. Most men only learn one knot -- the four-in-hand, which is a nice and asymmetrical knot suitable for most events. Better men know at least three, in increasing order of complexity and prestige: the four-in-hand, the half-Windsor, and the Windsor.

* I wore a four-in-hand to high school graduation and a half-Windsor to college graduation.  At eighteen, the only knot I knew was a four-in-hand, and at twenty-three, there was no excuse not to know more.

* I wore a Pratt to a job interview in southwestern Virginia, and apparently the part of my brain that parses "business formal" was turned off because I went in khakis and a dress shirt.  (Driving for six hours, round-trip, in suit trousers sounded like a bad idea.)  The interview process was shambolic and I wasn't shocked to not hear back from them. I dislike the Pratt knot for reasons other than that, but I don't wear it to interviews anymore.

* My standard now is to wear the half-Windsor if the event doesn't call for a "full" Windsor. If I'm ever summoned to court, you'd better believe I'll be wearing a Windsor.

* Every time I try to buy a bowtie, I always end up chickening out. It's not good interview apparel, and it's unlikely I'll end up in a job where I can use one as a fashion statement.

A few more notes about men's interview apparel (menswear being a hobby of mine):

* Navy pinstripe suits are win.  It's hard to go wrong with this classic power suit style for an interview.  You can always remove the jacket if the climate of the interview is less formal.

* Unless it's a very formal company, three-piece suits are not win.  If you ever find yourself interviewing at Grace Brothers, though, it's worth a second thought.

* If you wear a jacket, wear a pocket square with it. You're a cad if you don't.

* Black is the only valid color for leather at an interview. I carry a black briefcase, wear black shoes, and wear a black belt.  (Visible suspenders are not win.  You could wear them with a 3-piece suit, though, where they won't show since you've got the vest on over them.)
