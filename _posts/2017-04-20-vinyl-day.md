She's a rich girl, she don't try to hide it, diamonds on the soles of
her shoes.  People all over the world, join hands, start a love train,
the next stop that we make will be soon.  I'll send an SOS to the world,
I hope that someone gets my message in a bottle!

I've been vinyl shopping again, adding to the record collection I began
amassing in December.  My haul:

1.  "Don't Go Breaking My Heart" b/w "Snow Queen" 45rpm single by Elton
    John and Kiki Dee, Geffen Records
2.  "I Guess That's Why They Call It the Blues" b/w "The Retreat" 45rpm
    single by Elton John, Rocket/MCA
3.  "Invisible Touch" b/w "The Last Domino" 45rpm single by Genesis,
    Atlantic Records
4.  _The Popular Gershwin_ 45rpm album (12 sided box set), RCA Victor
5.  _Regatta de Blanc_ LP, The Police, A&M Records (1979 release, with
    original liner!)
6.  _Backstabbers_ LP, The O'Jays, Philadelphia Intl. Records (original
    1973 release, series-2 pressing)
7.  _Graceland_ CD, Paul Simon, Legacy Records (2012 reissue, 25th
    anniversary edition!)
8.  _The Sounds of Silence_ CD, Simon & Garfunkel, Columbia Records
    (1990 pressing, earliest CD issue as CK 9269)

One of the notches I seek to put in my belt as a vinyl collector is
having every LP (originals or reissues) and every 45rpm single released
by three of my favorite performers or groups: Paul Simon (and Simon &
Garfunkel), the Eagles, and Florence + the Machine.  So far, I'm nowhere
close.
