I'm instituting a new framework for making decisions in my life.  This
is an eternal work-in-progress and will probably never be complete.  To
summarize my rationale, this is a means of quantifying (insofar as I
can) or at least somehow qualifying my decisions in terms of when, to
what extent, and for what investment they will pay off.

<!--more-->

The canonical version of my decisionmaking process will be a living
document located on Google Drive, with the link to that document being
publicized in a subsequent revision of this post.  My goal here is to be
able to sit down when I am confronted with a decision and quickly, and
rationally, assess the impact it will have on the relevant areas of my
life, and thus drive how, why, and in what order I do things.

## The Three Dimensions: Magnitude, Timeframe, and Investment

Every decision has at least six data points associated with it: the date
it was committed to, the name and description of the decision, and the
magnitude, expected timeframe for arrival, and personally required
investment in its outcome.  Consider, for example, the decision I will
someday make to attend graduate school.  This is how I would qualify
that decision in deciding whether or not to make it.  (I probably won't
be going for a Public Health degree, but hey, I'm spitballing here.)

* Name: _Attend graduate school_
* Description: _Enroll self at Big State University in their Master of
  Public Health program with the goal of obtaining my MPH in Public
  Health so that I can become an obesity educator._
* Date: _Applied October 27, 2021; accepted January 10, 2022; first term
  begins August 2022_
* Magnitude: _Life-Altering_
* Timeframe: _3 to 4 years_
* Investment: _Monetary: substantial; Personal: substantial; Resources:
  moderate; Time: substantial_
* Prerequisites: _Secure funding; satisfy admission requirements; obtain
  admission; complete each class in the major._

A decision is assumed to be my conscious choice to undertake an action
that, once completed, will effect some sort of payoff or end result.
Google Dictionary defines the word _decision_ thusly: "a conclusion or
resolution reached after consideration."  The word ultimately comes from
the Latin _decido_, which [when used
figuratively](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/decido#Etymology_2), means
_agree_ or _settle_.  In my case, I assume that a decision is a
conclusion specifically about an action and whether or not I will
undertake it.  For example, I might decide to work out, but I might
decide against going skydiving.

In my system, I keep things deliberately coarse in terms of gradations.
There are four potential thresholds of magnitude, sorted from least to
most impactful:

* Inconsequential
* Minor
* Major
* Life-Altering

If I decide to go hiking, that's a minor decision.  But if [a boulder
falls on my forearm, crushing it, and I have to cut it off with a pocket
knife after more than 100 hours of being
trapped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aron_Ralston), or die from
exposure and/or starvation, that's a life-altering decision.  On the
brighter side, deciding to propose to my girlfriend (if I had one) would
also be a potentially life-altering decision; if nothing else, procuring
an engagement ring and setting up the proposal would be a major
decision.

The magnitude of a decision is completely subjective.

## Timeframe

I also keep things deliberately coarse in terms of expected timeframe to
payoff.  There are, again, four thresholds of timeframe, sorted from
most to least instantaneous.

* Very short-term (now to a matter of hours)
* Short-term (a matter of days)
* Medium-term (a matter of weeks to months)
* Long-term (a matter of years to decades)

Suppose I decide to go work out.  So I go, I load the bar, and I do my
moves.  At the end of the workout, I've achieved the very short-term
payoff of satisfaction from going to the gym, as well as the
post-workout high; it won't be for a day or two, but I'll achieve the
short-term payoff of increased strength and/or endurance, as well as a
better overall state of being, depending on what area I emphasize in my
training.  Working out is in furtherance of a larger goal, that of
changing my body composition, that I expect to take between 8 and 10
months.  The last ripple effect from this decision is the overall
improvement to my health and extension of my life expectancy, which I
won't feel for years or even decades.  On the other hand, if I decide to
drink a cup of coffee, I get the caffeine rush from the coffee, and if
I've had too much already, it may be harder for me to fall asleep that
night, but there's no long-term consequences from having a coffee habit.

Timeframes can also be impacted by deadlines.  If I have to have
something done by a certain time and date, that task is obviously of
greater importance than non-timeboxed tasks, and thus it has higher
priority.  I'll address priority later in this post.

The timeframe of a payoff is usually rather objective, since I know how
long it's going to take to do something in most cases.

## Investment

Likewise, I keep things coarse when it comes to expected investment.
There are, as always, four thresholds of investment, sorted from
smallest to greatest.  There are four axes of investment as well, since
I consider four major types of resource to be worth investing in a
decision.

* No investment at all: which is to say, I already have everything
  and/or everybody I need to act upon my decision, and I can act as
  quickly as my abilities and/or the laws of physics will allow
* Low investment: which is to say, I have to invest a little bit into my
  decision.
* Moderate investment: which is to say, I have to invest a moderate
  amount in my decision.
* Substantial investment: which is to say, I have to invest quite a lot
  into my decision.

I qualify investment along four axes, as I mentioned above, with each
axis representing something I have to invest in a decision.  All four
investment factors are graded the same way as overall investment is
graded: none, low, moderate, or substantial.

* Money: Whether you call it quid, _dinero_, greenbacks, cash, or
  whatever.  It takes money to do anything in this world.
* Time: You get 86,400 seconds of this per day.  Use them wisely.
* Resources: Non-monetary resources like personal connections, physical
  assets (cars, computers, etc.), abilities and skills, consumable items
  (e.g. gas, camera film, protein powder), etc.
* Effort: How hard I have to work at a given decision to make it come to
  fruition.

The sum of these four factors determines how great the investment is in
the decision's outcome.  Let's break down my decision to get in shape
along these lines.

* **Money**: It costs me $16.38 per month (after sales tax) to keep my gym
  membership.  The round-trip drive time is in the neighborhood of 5-10
  minutes depending on traffic, and my car gets about 7 L/100km in city
  driving.  It's a 7km round trip, so 14 trips to the gym are enough to
  blow through 100km of driving.  Petrol costs $0.55 per liter at
  current prices, so my total petrol expenditure per 14 trips to the gym
  is $3.85.  I take about as many trips to the gym in a month's time, so
  my total monetary expenditure for the gym is $18.85 per month plus an
  annual maintenance fee of $29.  Total annual cost with petrol,
  assuming its price remains fixed: $255.20.  This doesn't factor in
  wear and tear on my car, and for such a short drive, I feel confident
  factoring that cost out.  Since I live with my parents and can
  partially ride on their grocery bill, I spend $70-90 on my own food,
  like 1 kg bags of frozen salmon, 500g bags of quinoa, 2L cartons of
  almondmilk, and occasional 1kg bottles of protein powder.
* **Time**: Counting drive time and floor time, it takes me about 1-1/2
  hours to go to, work out at, and return from the gym.  This is exactly
  6.25% of my day, and it's going to a very good cause, so it's time I'm
  only willing to spend.  When it comes to food, I can prepare myself a
  meal pretty quickly, anywhere from 10-30 minutes.  And whenever I do
  eat, I take a few extra moments to record the calories.  To do this
  twice a day (eating dinner with the family), I spend anywhere from 20
  minutes to 1 hour -- again, a small percentage of my day relative to
  what I get out of it.
* **Resources**: I have gym shorts, workout shirts, underwear, socks,
  lifting shoes, and most of the other things I need and/or want to use
  at the gym.  (e.g. lifting belt, mouth guard, wrist wraps, exercise
  tracker -- the only thing I lack is a pair of straps)  So there's no
  investment, aside from periodically replacing worn-out gym shorts and
  swapping out shirts, in going to the gym.  As far as food goes, that's
  a replenishing resource.
* **Effort**: It takes no effort to drive out to, or return home from, the
  gym.  That being said, it takes a substantial amount of physical
  effort while I'm there, as you'd expect.  (Hey, 315 pounds aren't
  going to squat themselves!)  It also takes more than inconsequential
  effort -- I'd say a moderate amount of effort -- to watch my diet and
  cook for myself.

## Bucketing Decisions and The Matrix

<figcaption>The matrix, yesterday.

</figure>

This is basically a homebrew universal decision matrix.  A _decision
matrix_ is a device you use to compare factors across choices for
something you have to decide.  For example, you may need to choose a
vendor for some widget you need for your business, and you'd compare
each widget-maker based on price per widget, manufacturing quality,
proximity to your distribution center, quality of customer service, so
on and so forth.  My matrix is less an explicit matrix (for one thing,
it's in three dimensions, not two) and more of a framework into which I
can abstract the factors of decisions I need or want to make.

I can inform my decision-making process by qualifying every decision
with these parameters, and I can thus determine what needs to be done,
how it needs to be done, and when I need to do it.  In particular, I use
these factors to determine how quickly I must act, along these axes.

* Actions with a high expected payoff should be done before tasks with a
  lower expected payoff.
* Actions with a low expected investment should be done before tasks
  with a higher expected investment.
* Actions that pay off quickly should done before those that pay off
  farther into the future.
* Actions with a deadline should be addressed before those without
  one.
* Actions that require the involvement of multiple people should be
  coordinated such that they can be done to the maximum convenience
  of all involved persons, and should be considered before solo
  activities, which can be done at any time.

Investment takes precedence over magnitude, which takes precedence in
turn over timeframe except when a task is timeboxed.  Then timeframe
takes the highest precedence.  This leads to the fact that the
highest-priority items are those with a low investment, that have a big
payoff, that will pay off quickly.  Some of these actions also pay off
in the long term.

* Anything under a deadline
* Paying bills (including household shopping, such as grocery trips
  and buying household goods)
* Going to work (or school), or finding work if you are
  unemployed/underemployed/unhappy/a broke-ass blogger
* Maintenance of your preferred mode of transportation
* Topping up your bus card
* Working on your bike
* Changing oil and rotating the tires on your car
* Making sure your walking shoes are in good condition
* Eating healthily
* Exercising
* Cleaning house
* Doing laundry
* Maintaining friendships (e.g. lunch together, shared
  interests, just talking, etc.)
* Maintaining romance (dates, shared interests, just
  talking, sex, etc.)
* De-stressing (meditation, running, spending time in
  nature, etc.)

It's not like doing any of these things will immediately change your
life, but _not_ doing them _will_ change your life -- for the worse,
whether it's letting friendships deteriorate, losing your romantic
relationship, losing your job (or getting kicked out of school), being
delinquent on a bill, etc.  Notice that I don't include social media
here, because I feel that social media is not a legitimate use of your
time except as filler.

Next up are those tasks with a slightly higher investment, a slightly
longer time to payoff, and/or a slightly lower impact.  Examples:

* Looking for new friends
* Looking for new romance
* Networking
* Doing hobbies
* Doing discretionary shopping (e.g. trips to the bookstore,
  electronics shop, coffee house, or record store)
* Furthering your education (reading books/magazines,
  watching TED talks, listening to recorded lectures, etc.)
* Repairing broken items, e.g. computers, appliances, etc.
* Purchasing new major appliances/electronics/furnishings,
  e.g. a new computer, TV, washing machine, or bedroom suite
* Household organization (as an act distinct from cleaning
  house or doing the laundry)
* Diet planning
* Exercise planning

Next up are those tasks with a higher investment still, a greater delay
to payoff, or an even lower impact.

* Charitable donations, including volunteering your time
* Learning new techniques for your line of work or a hobby
  (e.g. how to develop film, how to take pictures without a
  light meter, how to record 78rpm records to a computer)
* Looking for a new residence if you wish to move
* Developing a side job to complement or eventually replace
  your day job
* Looking for a new mode of transport (new car, bike, etc.)
* Investigating formal education
* Writing a business plan (unless this is part of your job)

The last tasks to consider are those with the highest investment, the
greatest delay to payoff, or the lowest impact on your daily life.

* Pursuing formal education
* Buying a new house, or adding on to your existing one
* Buying a new car
* Starting a company
* Having a child (via the traditional method or via adoption)

These activities call for a substantial investment of time, money,
effort, and resources.  (The act of conception doesn't necessarily call
for a large amount of effort, but raising a child sure as hell does, and
so does adoption.) But all five of these things have very high potential
payoffs, from the joys and sorrows of parenthood to that new-car smell
(and new-car reliability) or that corner office on the 75th floor, the
one you have to have an MBA, in addition to peerless experience, to get.
And sure, those things take a while to get.  It takes months to close on
a house, while it takes years to pay off a house or car.  It takes
months to years to realize the potential benefits of owning a business,
and as any collegian can tell you, it takes years to get a college
degree.

The tasks below contribute nothing to your life, and should be avoided
since they require no investment, never grant a payoff, and in fact
don't even have a payoff.

* Using social media
* Watching television, outside of some documentaries or 
  accurate news (e.g. BBC News, _NewsHour_)
  * Loath as I am to do so, I'd even consider spectator
    sports to be mindless unless you use it as a reason to
    have friends over.  You'd best believe that if I ever
    meet a fellow Broncos fan, there'll be viewing parties
    at my place.
* Eating excessively
* Reading mindless books, magazines, websites, or other written items
* Excessively posting to internet forums
* Listening to mindless music
  * Some people would consider any popular music at all to
    fall into this category.  Those people are what I like
    to call "wrong as fuck."

The common thread of these activities is that they break you down rather
than build you up and may as well constitute doing nothing.  I think
Henri Peyre, the Yale University French professor, said it best in 1944:

> Yet there is no sorrier sight to watch then the vacant faces of those
> former high school and college students when, at thirty-five or fifty,
> all their mental alertness having vanished, the spark gone from their
> eyes, they dutifully chew their gum to keep from yawning, while
> absorbing the chewing gum for the eyes of the movies or the chewing
> gum for the ears of the radio.

## Takeaways

Looking at life through the lens of the decision cube (for lack of a
better term to call it) has already started to pay off a bit.  By
understanding the ways in which a given decision would impact my life, I
can take a step back, look at things more objectively, and act
accordingly.  This process will never be a hundred percent completely
defined, and like I said, it will be refined continuously for as long as
I live.
