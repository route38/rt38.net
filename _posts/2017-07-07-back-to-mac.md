I bought a MacBook recently and I'm back to using Snow Leopard to get
things done.  Fun!  I also got an iPhone 6S and I'm having a gay old
time relearning all of the iOS I'd forgotten I knew.  The space gray
iPhone goes surprisingly well with my gray Chromebook Pixel, and I'm
officially in love with the San Francisco system font on the iPhone,
enough so that it's now my system font on the Chromebook.

In unrelated news, I'm looking for a job.  Anybody with any leads,
openings, potential references, interview tips, size 42R suit jackets,
free non-tacky neckties, hog bristle shaving brushes, wingtip shoes,
Rolex watches, winning lottery tickets, Apple computers, or really lousy
(but clean) jokes that I can tell off the cuff in tense interviews
should get in touch at <mail@tnwae.us>.
