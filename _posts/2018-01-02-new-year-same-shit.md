2018 is upon us and that means 2&frac12; things.

## Thing the first: Will work for ~~food~~ iPad

I'm looking for work, as [blogged](//vsdev.org/2018/01/bienvenue) at my
tech blog and reblogged at my lifestyle blog.  I've got other stuff in
the cards for 2018, of course, but job search is the most important
thing by far.  If you have any advice, leads, or interview offers,
please fling them my way by emailing <mail@tnwae.us> or pestering me on
LinkedIn or Twitter.

## Thing the second: Webdev courses/books/whatever

Because the job search ~~might~~ will take a while, I'm whiling away my
time by reviving my webdev skills.  If you've got any recommendations
for a code-inclined frontend-preferring would-be web developer, you know
how to get in touch.

## Thing the second-and-a-halfeth: updates incoming

This website is due for a few updates and changes, including a new look
for 2018 and some refinements for the portfolio and resume.  Watch this
space.
