      <dt>Need a writer?</dt>
      <dd>
        <em>Feb. 2017</em> &mdash;
        I've opened myself up to offering my services as a writer for
        Web and print, though mostly the former.  If you need a writer
        with Linux knowledge, general technical expertise, and a sharp
        sense of style <em>and</em> substance, email <a
        href='mailto:work@tnwae.us'>work@tnwae.us</a> with your
        requirements.

        <em>Feb. 2017</em> &mdash;
        vsdev.org is my main blog.  I may be bringing up a tech-centric
        blog, probably focusing on Linux and Ruby, at a new domain TBD.
        Coming at the end of February is a blog about getting myself
        back on track, called <a href='//alwaysbechasing.net'>Always Be
        Chasing</a>. tnwae.us (this site) will serve as a vanity page,
        status center, and online resume.

        I'm forwarding everything from this address to
        <tt>mail@tnwae.us</tt> for the time being, and I will kill the
        domain sometime soon since I no longer have use for the
        Microsoft Account tied to it.

        <em class='book-title'>On Writing Well</em> by
        <span class='author'>William Zinsser</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        An excellent guide to writing nonfiction.  I make it a point to
        read this one at least every year.
      </dd>

      <dt class='book'>
        <em class='book-title'>Getting Things Done</em> by
        <span class='author'>David Allen</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        The ultimate masterwork of modern productivity.  If you're too
        busy to read this book, that's why you need to read it.
      </dd>

        <em class='book-title'>Red Storm Rising</em> by
        <span class='author'>Tom Clancy</span>
      </dt>
      <dd>
        A wonderful tale of tension and terror in the late Soviet era.
        Dated, but still wonderful.

      <dt>Pok&eacute;mon Moon (3DS)</dt>
      <dd>
        The last major title I bought.  I wasn't overly impressed.  X
        was way better.
      </dd>
                  
      <dt>Pok&eacute;mon Red (3DS VC)</dt>
      <dd>
        I'd rather play this than Moon, which is really saying something
        for this mainstay of my youth.
      </dd>
                  
      <dt>Wii Sports</dt>
      <dd>
        For a 11-year-old collection of minigames, it's still surprisingly
        fresh.  I think it's because it's so approachable.  Wii Bowling,
        in particular, is one of the reasons I keep my Wii plugged up.
      </dd>
                  
      <dt>Tecmo Super Bowl (NES)</dt>
      <dd>
        The ultimate 2D football game, and &mdash; thanks to Bo Jackson
        &mdash; the only football game where I'll pick the Raiders.  Need
        I say more?

      <dt>Slackware 14.2 (amd64)</dt>

      <dd>
        On Sagarmatha.  My first serious attempt at using Slack, originally
        configured on Elbrus and moved to Sagarmatha.  Only 6 hours to
        compile Chromium with the i7!

      <dt>Windows 7 Pro (x64)</dt>
      <dd>
        On Elbrus.  Configured with a 1TB hard drive for maximum storage
        (needed for ripping vinyl) and some Windows software I need for
        writing and work.
      </dd>

      <dt>Debian 8 (powerpc)</dt>
      <dd>
        On Vinson.  Performance is tolerable, especially considering how
        old the laptop is.  Linux almost offers better driver support
        than Apple.  Almost.
