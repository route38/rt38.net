## Email and Social Media Policy

I happily accept email sent to <mail@tnwae.us>.  If you want to get in touch, that's the best way to do it.  When you send me a message, be sure to:

1. State your name or desired pseudonym.
2. Ask your question(s) clearly and concisely.
3. Write in English or French.

If I deem it worthy of responding to, I'll do my best to get back to you within 36 hours.  I work an odd schedule in my usual job, so I can't always get to the computer in time, and I don't answer emails from my phone.

You can also send me a message on Twitter or LinkedIn if that's more your style.

I do not respond to marketing emails.  If you try to sell me something in an
email, it is spam and I will not answer it.

If you send me an email or a social media post, you agree that you surrender irrevocably all rights to the content of the message and further agree that I may post the content of such mail, with identifying information redacted, to this site for the purpose of commentary and criticism.

## Privacy Policy

I do not, as a matter of operations, collect identifying information from you simply by your visiting this website.  I do, however, collect analytical data via Google Analytics, which includes but is not limited to:

* The user agent string of your browser, which identifies said browser by name,
  version, and operating system,[^1]
* Your IP address, sent as part of every HTTP request you make,
* Your geographic location[^2], as inferred by your IP address, and
* Your ISP[^3], as inferred by your IP address.

I use this data solely in aggregate form to inform my decisions about how best
to promote this site and to select content.  In no way do I ever attempt to
identify individual users of this site.

If you send me an email with personally identifying information, or a social media message, I will redact all potentially personalizing information from it unless such information is part of the metadata of the post (e.g. a Tweet or a LinkedIn update).

## Code of Ethics

My new code of blogging ethics is based on the Code of Ethics for the Norwegian Press, promulgated by the Norwegian Press Association and provided in English at [mor10.com](https://mor10.com/code-of-ethics-for-bloggers-social-media-and-content-creators/).  My code of ethics is very simple: do whatever youp lease, so long as you:

0. Voice your opinion, and defend your right to do so.
1. Be critical of everything, especially yourself.
2. Use your power to create content in a positive way.
3. Tell the truth always.
4. Present your opinion as your opinion.  *Never state opinion, conjecture, or interpretation as fact.*
5. State your allegiances to stay independent.
6. Reveal your sources unless doing so can harm them.
7. Be critical of your sources and seek independent verification.
8. Always give credit where it's due.
9. Always preserve the intended meaning of a given statement.
10. Give your opponent a chance to respond.
11. Preserve original posts, except for fixing mistakes.  Admit and correct mistakes immediately.

To these, I add some provisions.

0. Stay on topic.
1. Don't post for posting's sake; only post if you have something substantive to add.
2. Don't allow comments, anonymous or otherwise.  Invite fellow bloggers to respond to you on their own blogs.
3. Disagree respectfully and vigorously, but never venomously.
4. Link directly to sources or otherwise provide the shortest path between reader and sources, e.g. ISBN.
5. Don't blog for favours.  All content should be created strictly for editorial purposes.  In particular, do not succumb to the temptation to write a sponsored post in return for free goods.
6. Do not divulge the identities of confidential sources.
7. Do not link to, give clicks to, quote from, or otherwise give attention to unscrupulous and unethical sources.  The lifeblood of these sources is attention, and denying them attention is how you win the battle against them.

I intend upon never accepting offers for sponsored posts or free products, should they arise.  When I review something here on tnwae.us, I do so after having purchased it with my own funds, such that my impressions are always accurate and always wholly my own.  In short, if something sucks, I'm going to tell you.

[^1]: For example, the user agent string of the browser on my iBook G4 is "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; PPC Mac OS X 10.5; rv:31.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/31.0 TenFourFox/7450," which identifies me as using the G4e variant of TenFourFox on Mac OS X Leopard.

[^2]: I cannot precisely locate where you live based on the data given to me.  The geolocation data collected by Google Analytics only locates as far as specific cities, meaning I can't really pinpoint you any further than, say, Denver, Colorado, USA.

[^3]: If you access Route 38 at work, I may be able to ascertain where you work if your company operates as an ISP (as opposed to Comcast or Charter or whomever).  By the way, Googlers, yes, I would be interested.
