## Disclaimers

The content presented here does not represent the position, strategies,
or opinions of my employer(s).  Additionally, my thoughts, opinions, and
beliefs change from time to time, which is a necessary consequence of
having an open mind.  Accordingly, this website is intended to provide a

## Linking Policy

If you wish to link to a VSDev article, please use the permalink given
at the bottom of the post itself, and be sure to use HTTPS in your link.
The `www` subdomain is optional when referencing the site's domain, but
I prefer _not_ to use it.  For example, to link to my Chromebook Pixel
review from early 2017, look at this example:

```
    This is Grace's _Chips and Bits_ blogosphere roundup for March 2017.

    Remember the Chromebook Pixel?  That aluminum block of "WTF were
    they thinking?" by Google?  Well, I had one back in the day.
    William Ellison took [a look at the original Chromebook Pixel][vsdev]
    recently, and rather like I, he had mostly positive things to say about
    it...

## Email and Social Media Policy

I begrudgingly accept email sent to <mail@tnwae.us>.  If you want to get
in touch, that's the best way to do it.  When you send me a message, be
sure to:

1. State your name or desired pseudonym.
2. Ask your question(s) clearly and concisely.
3. Write in English or French.

If I deem it worthy of responding to, I'll do my best to get back to you
within 36 hours.  I work an odd schedule in my usual job, so I can't
always get to the computer in time, and I don't answer emails from my
phone.

My GnuPG thumbprint is 0xBC774615, and my public key is [available
locally](/etc/mailtnwaeus.asc) and [at the MIT keyserver][mit-pks].  I
only send signed emails so that you know that any time you receive an
email from me, it is guaranteed to be from me.

[mit-pks]: https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xFAF390DCBC774615

You can also send me a message on Twitter or LinkedIn if that's more
your style.

I do not respond to marketing emails.  If you try to sell me something
in an email, it is spam and I will not answer it.

If you send me an email or a social media post, you agree that you
surrender irrevocably all rights to the content of the message and
further agree that I may post the content of such mail, with identifying
information redacted, to this site for the purpose of commentary and
criticism.

## Privacy Policy

I do not, as a matter of operations, collect identifying information
from you simply by your visiting this website.  I do, however, collect
analytical data via Google Analytics, which includes but is not limited
to:

* The user agent string of your browser, which identifies said browser
  by name, version, and operating system,[^1]

* Your IP address, sent as part of every HTTP request you make,

* Your geographic location[^2], as inferred by your IP address, and

* Your ISP[^3], as inferred by your IP address.

I use this data solely in aggregate form to inform my decisions about
how best to promote this site and to select content.  In no way do I
ever attempt to identify individual users of this site.

If you send me an email with personally identifying information, or a
social media message, I will redact all potentially personalizing
information from it unless such information is part of the metadata of
the post (e.g. a Tweet or a LinkedIn update).

## Code of Ethics

My new code of blogging ethics is based on the Code of Ethics for the
Norwegian Press, promulgated by the Norwegian Press Association and
provided in English at
[mor10.com](https://mor10.com/code-of-ethics-for-bloggers-social-media-and-content-creators/).
My code of ethics is very simple: do whatever you please, so long as
you:

0.  Voice your opinion, and defend your right to do so.

1.  Be critical of everything, especially yourself.

2.  Use your power to create content in a positive way.

3.  Tell the truth always.

4.  Present your opinion as your opinion.  In particular, *never state
    opinion, conjecture, or interpretation as fact.*

5.  State your allegiances so as to maintain editorial independence.

6.  Reveal your sources unless doing so can harm them, or unless they
    specifically request anonymity.

7.  Be critical of your sources and seek independent verification.

8.  Always give credit where it's due.

9.  Always preserve the intended meaning of a given statement.

10. Give your opponent a chance to respond.

11. Preserve original posts, except for fixing mistakes.  Admit and
    correct mistakes immediately.

To these, I add some provisions.

0.  Stay on topic.

1.  Don't post for posting's sake; only post if you have something
    substantive to add.

2.  Don't allow comments, anonymous or otherwise.  Invite fellow
    bloggers to respond to you on their own blogs.

3.  Disagree respectfully and vigorously, but never venomously.

4.  Link directly to sources or otherwise provide the shortest path
    between reader and sources, e.g. ISBN.

5.  Don't blog for favours.  All content should be created strictly for
    editorial purposes.  In particular, do not succumb to the temptation
    to write a sponsored post in return for free goods.

6.  Do not divulge the identities of confidential sources.

7.  Do not link to, give clicks to, quote from, or otherwise give
    attention to unscrupulous and unethical sources.  The lifeblood of
    these sources is attention, and denying them attention is how you
    win the battle against them.

Products reviewed at vsdev are purchased with my own funds and are, in
particular, never accepted in return for the creation of a review, true
or otherwise.  There is no sponsored content here, and every last
impression of a product reviewed here is mine and mine alone.

[^1]: As an example, my current useragent is "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; CrOS x86_64 9000.91.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/56.0.2924.110 Safari/537.36", which identifies me as using Chrome OS, the 64-bit build, with Chrome 56.

[^2]: I cannot precisely locate where you live based on the data given to me.  The geolocation data collected by Google Analytics only locates as far as specific cities, meaning I can't really pinpoint you any further than, say, Denver, Colorado, USA.

[^3]: If you access VSDev at work, I may be able to ascertain where you work if your company operates as an ISP, as many large companies do.
