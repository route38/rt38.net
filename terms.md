## Disclaimers

The content presented here does not represent the position, strategies, or opinions of my employer(s).  Additionally, my thoughts, opinions, and beliefs change from time to time, which is a necessary consequence of having an open mind.  Accordingly, this website is intended to provide a transparent, semi-permanent snapshot and manifestation of the various ideas within my mind.  As such, thoughts and opinions expressed in outdated posts may not be the same as, or even similar to, views that I hold today.

## Linking Policy

If you wish to link to a _Route 38_ article, please use the permalink given at the bottom of the post itself, and be sure to use HTTPS in your link.  The `www` subdomain is optional when referencing the site's domain, but I prefer _not_ to use it.

## Email and Social Media Policy

Please send email to <waellison@gmail.com> if you wish to get in touch.  If you send a message, please be sure to:

1. State your name or desired pseudonym.
2. Ask your question(s) clearly and concisely.
3. Write in English or French.

I'll do my best to respond to your query within 48 hours.  You can also send me a message on Twitter or LinkedIn if that's more your style; I am [@waedotpy](https://twitter.com/waedotpy) on Twitter and [/in/tnwae](https://linkedin.com/in/tnwae) on LinkedIn.

I do not respond to marketing emails.  If you try to sell me something in an email, then I will consider it as spam and I will not answer it.

If you send me an email or a social media post, you agree that you surrender irrevocably all rights to the content of the message and further agree that I may post the content of such mail, with identifying information redacted, to this site for the purpose of commentary and criticism.

## Privacy Policy

I do not, as a matter of operations, collect identifying information from you simply by your visiting this website.  Out of respect for your privacy, I do not set cookies, I do not use external dependencies (aside from Google Web Fonts), and I do not use analytics software.

If you send me an email with personally identifying information, or a social media message, I will redact all potentially personalizing information from it unless such information is part of the metadata of the post (e.g. a Tweet or a LinkedIn update).

## Code of Ethics

My code of blogging ethics is based on the Code of Ethics for the Norwegian Press, promulgated by the Norwegian Press Association and provided in English at
[mor10.com](https://mor10.com/code-of-ethics-for-bloggers-social-media-and-content-creators/).  My code of ethics is very simple: do whatever you please, so long as you:

0.  Voice your opinion, and defend your right to do so.

1.  Be critical of everything, especially yourself.

2.  Use your power to create content in a positive way.

3.  Tell the truth always.

4.  Present your opinion as your opinion.  In particular, *never state opinion, conjecture, or interpretation as fact.*

5.  State your allegiances so as to maintain editorial independence.

6.  Reveal your sources unless doing so can harm them, or unless they specifically request anonymity.

7.  Be critical of your sources and seek independent verification.

8.  Always give credit where it's due.

9.  Always preserve the intended meaning of a given statement.

10. Give your opponent a chance to respond.

11. Preserve original posts, except for fixing mistakes.  Admit and correct mistakes immediately.

To these, I add some provisions.

0.  Stay on topic.

1.  Don't post for posting's sake; only post if you have something substantive to add.

2.  Don't allow comments, anonymous or otherwise.  Invite fellow
    bloggers to respond to you on their own blogs.

3.  Disagree respectfully and vigorously, but never venomously.

4.  Link directly to sources or otherwise provide the shortest path between reader and sources, e.g. ISBN.

5.  Don't blog for favours.  All content should be created strictly for editorial purposes.  In particular, do not succumb to the temptation to write a sponsored post in return for free goods.

6.  Do not divulge the identities of confidential sources.

7.  Do not link to, give clicks to, quote from, or otherwise give attention to unscrupulous and unethical sources.  The lifeblood of these sources is attention, and denying them attention is how you win the battle against them.

Products and services that I review at _Route 38_ are purchased with my own funds.  I do not accept free products or services in exchange for reviews and this site will never host sponsored content.  If you wish to send me an example of your product, or provide me with a complimentary membership to your service, please move along as I will not accept your promotional offer (and even if you assert otherwise, it is a promotional offer).
