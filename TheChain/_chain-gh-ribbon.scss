// Some years ago, when I had a portfolio, I linked to my github account
// for each project with publicly available source code.  To do this,
// you'd usually include an official ribbon, but since my photoshop
// skills are restricted to actual photo editing, I opted instead to
// make a GitHub ribbon out of pure HTML and CSS.  This is the CSS side
// of that.
