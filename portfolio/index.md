## Websites

It goes without saying that a web developer makes websites.  Here are
the sites I've done so far.

* tnwae.us (you're here now; check out the [colophon](/colophon))
* [vsdev](/portfolio/projects/web/vsdev) at <https://vsdev.org>
* [Between the Sprocket Holes](/portfolio/projects/web/btsh) at <https://sprocketholes.net>
* [Always Be Chasing](/portfolio/projects/web/abc) at <https://alwaysbechasing.net>

All of these sites are served using Apache 2.4, PHP 7, MariaDB 10, and
Ubuntu Server 16.04 "Xenial Xerus."

## Writings

As my blogging efforts might imply, my strongest form of communication
is writing.  As such, I consider it a responsibility to upload written
things that I have created describing my professional life.
