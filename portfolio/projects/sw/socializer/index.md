I began using [Jekyll][jrb] in 2013 owing to its ease of use,
amenability to tweaking, and sheer speed on even the slowest HTTP
servers thanks to its rendering of static HTML pages.  While I no longer
use it for every website I create, I still use it for tnwae.us and for
[VSDev][vsdev], my technical blog.  To make things easier in Jekyll, I
use a variety of plugins and libraries for expediting development
efforts.  Chief among these is my own Socializer plugin, which enables
me to plop a list of social network links pretty much anywhere in my
templates.

[jrb]: //jekyllrb.com
[vsdev]: //vsdev.org

Socializer allows you to define the social networks you use in your
site's `_config.yml`, then place a `social_networks` tag within your
templates.  The result, visible in the site footer, is a collection of
links that you can style as you see fit.  The code below is the actual
collection of links you see in the footer, and is generated by the
current revision of Socializer.

{% social_networks %}
