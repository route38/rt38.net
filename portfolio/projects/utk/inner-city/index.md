This was a paper submitted in partial satisfaction of the course
requirements for Africana Studies 480, "African Americans in the Urban
Environment," a course I took for satisfaction of a distribution
requirement.

## Fast Facts

Collaborators
: Myself and five other students.

When
: Fall 2009, throughout the month of November

Brief description
: A research paper and slide deck presented in regard to the subject of
  educational inequality in the American inner city, with particular
  regard to inequalities along racial lines.

Scope
: Performing and drawing conclusions from research, working jointly with
  my collaborators in so doing; compiling and copy-editing the resulting
  paper into a finished product; presenting our findings via a slide deck
  to the rest of the class and the professor.

Tools Used
: Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Outlook

Lessons Learned
: Effective collaboration in person and via email; writing and editing
  in the style expected of sociological papers; presenting to a small
  group.

## About the project

The goal of the project was to compose a research paper about 5,000
words in length about some aspect of Black life in urban America.
Several sample topics were given and the topic of this paper is based on
one of those sample topics.  As is the norm in sociological projects,
the APA style was indicated for formatting, citations, and bibliographic
entries; outside of this requirement and the indicated length, all else
was up to us.

It was our responsibility to perform the resarch that would prove the
claims we made, as well as to draw conclusions from it while exploring
the chosen issue.

## Scope of the work

The lead paragraph of the paper adequately describes the scope of the
project insofar as research and writing are concerned:

> It is a known and well-researched fact that in the United States,
> schools located in the "inner city" -- a region of American urban
> areas distinguished by high minority populations, high poverty rates,
> and low average wage earnings -- are not as successful as their peer
> schools in the suburbs.  There are several main issues that lead to
> poor performance, and in this paper, we will examine several
> attributes of the urban school system: first, identifying factors in
> the community that lead to diminished performance; second, motivating
> factors that lead teachers to prefer working elsewhere; third, why
> some inner-city schools succeed; fourt, attitudes of all the members
> of the inner-city educational system; fifth, the influence of
> geography; finally, political viewpoints on how to resolve the issue.

For my part, I researched identifying factors within the community and
did extra research to bolster the others' claims.  I also took
responsibility for collecting the others' work and organizing it into a
cohesive, coherent final product.

## Result

While I do not know the others' final grades, I earned a B in the
course.  This paper was the final project in the course and the themes
it explores are the threads that had been woven throughout the course.
I gained a deeper appreciation for the power of group work and was very
grateful for my team's contributions.  This paper also sparked my
interest in the subject matter, and to this day I occasionally read
_Pacific Standard_, a magazine written largely from a progressive
viewpoint.

This project also gave me a reason to quote the Marvin Gaye song "Inner
City Blues," which was neat because I love his music.
