## About the project

As a child, I greatly enjoyed the top-down RPG _Castle of the Winds_, a classic Rougelike game for Microsoft Windows.  Unfortunately, COTW was written for 16-bit Windows and no longer works with modern versions of the system.  For my graphical user interface class at UT, I decided to try my hand at creating a modern-day clone of the game, using the Java programming language for ease of programming and modifiability.

## Scope of the work

Our task was to create the graphical frontend to the game, consisting of the game map, status area, and movement about the field.  These goals were met, but not without significant struggle owing to my poor understanding of the division of tasks in the Model-View-Controller paradigm.  I also had difficulty expanding upon my original idea, which led to leadership difficulties from the outset.  Compounding this was the overhead of learning a new language, development environment, version control system, and organizational paradigm:

0. Java (this was my first course in Java)
1. NetBeans (see above; I had used the Unix command line as my environment prior to this course)
2. Mercurial (we were taught Subversion)
3. Collaboration via Google Code (the page is now defunct)

I would have changed all these variables in retrospect:

0. C# or IronRuby (if you're gonna learn a new language, do it right)
1. Visual Studio or Vim (see above)
2. Git (if you're gonna learn a new VCS, do it right)
3. GitHub (which *was* around at this point, and my sole regret is not signing up there sooner)

## Result

I learned more about the importance of a strong project vision by doing this project than I ever would have by any other task.  The project was, strictly speaking, a failure, although we did all pass the class.  There were five primary takeaways from this project:

0. A clear project vision is important, but more important than that is combatting scope creep -- or its equally insidious twin brother, scope retreat.
1. Leadership should overlook friendships and seek results.  Friendship is for after hours; working relationships shouldn't be cozy just because the participants happen to be friends.
2. Bad design decisions frequently stem from crucial misunderstandings of design concepts.  It therefore pays to have solid understanding of the concepts underlying the design; in the case of MVC, the roles of models, views, and controllers must be clearly delineated and followed.
3. There's a fine line between being insufficiently ambitious on a project pitch (since you'll never sell) and being overly ambitious (since you oversell).  Significantly overselling was my biggest single mistake on this project.
4. Never choose a crucial project to cut your teeth with a new tool.  Always learn new tools in the comfort of your home, far from anything that, if broken, leads to lost money, time, or productivity.  Tools include languages, dev environments, dev tools, and collaboration suites.
