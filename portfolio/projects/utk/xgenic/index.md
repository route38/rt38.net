## Fast Facts

Collaborators
: Myself (both) and three others (Biology only)

When
: Fall 2008, throughout the semester

Brief description
: A position paper and presentations arguing in favor of the use of
  genetically modified organisms for partially solving world hunger.

Scope
: Researching and drawing conclusions from biological, agricultural, and
  economic literature; synthesizing these conclusions into both a paper on
  the subject (length 3,000 words) and two presentations, one focusing on
  the human impact and the other focusing on the science.

Result
: Grades of B+ in Biology 101 and B in Communication Studies, with A
  grades earned on the assignments themselves.

Lessons Learned
: Telling a human story is the most valuable asset a presenter has, and
  when that isn't enough, facts do the talking.  (But it's usually
  enough.)

## About the project

Some 6.6 billion people lived in the world in 2008, when the project was
being researched, and out of those, some one in six experienced
malnutrition or food insecurity.  I made the comparison that the 1.1
billion people going hungry in the world could fill the record capacity
(108,647 people) of Neyland Stadium more than 10,000 times, or fill up
more than 2.4 million Boeing 747 airliners at max seating capacity.  The
comparison to the stadium was particularly apropos in speech class,
since one could easily see the stadium from the windows of our
classroom.

In biology, six positions were presented regarding the use of GMOs in
world agriculture, and our group's stakeholder was a world hunger
advocate who believed that GMOs provided a powerful solution to stopping
hunger and malnutrition.  To this end, we examined the scientific,
agricultural, nutritional, and economic implications of using GMOs to
grow crops in areas where there are food shortages.

## Scope of the work

My responsibilities on the biology project included researching the
biological and agricultural science behind GMOs and their use, as well
as taking up contributions from the rest of the group and rolling them
together into the final paper.  I also compiled the presentation given
during a laboratory session.

I had full responsibility for the presentation in my speaking class, and
I took advantage of having already done the underlying research by
compiling an outline and structuring a visual presentation around a very
similar premise.  As always, relentless practice in giving the
presentation ensured that by the time my turn came up, I knew exactly
what to say and how to say it.  I argued in favor of using GMOs such as
Golden Rice to combat hunger and malnutrition.

## Result

There were four primary outcomes from this project.  I earned A's on
both projects, furthering my progress toward solid B grades in each
course.  More important were these three outcomes:

* Data is data, regardless of where or how you cite it.  Data tells a
  story, and it's up to you to figure out what that story is.

* Preparation is key, and practice is the single largest form of
  preparation.  If you don't practice a presentation, you will
  inevitably falter when time to stand and deliver.

* Most important of all: if you make your story human, people will
  listen, and some of them may even agree with you.  I imparted humanity
  on my story by showing what one in six people looked like, both in
  numbers and in absolute terms.  My most poignant slide in the
  presentation I gave was of a child sitting in a high chair, munching
  on some Golden Rice, a strain of rice fortified with beta carotene and
  vitamin A and having a distinctive golden color as a result.  That
  child, and millions like him, can see because of Golden Rice and
  genetically enhanced crops like it.  (Childhood sight loss is a major
  problem in the developing world and carotene insufficiency in the diet
  is a proximal cause.)
