<h2>Nuventure</h2>
<p>
  A text-based adventure game written for the POSIX command line.  Created
  in Python, using the Natural Language Toolkit to parse English text into
  internal commands.  Meant to be an homage to the early era of video gaming
  when the interactive fiction genre was at its apex.
