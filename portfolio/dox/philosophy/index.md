## Working Philosophy

I hold these truths to be self-evident as a technologist:

* Programming is the art of making a fast, dumb machine do slow, smart
  things.

* The user comes first without exception, for without users there is no
  company.

* A positive attitude is an employee's most important tool.  Positivity
  breeds enthusiasm, and enthusiastic learning trumps indifferent
  expertise.

* An admin's work product is the network he or she oversees, as well as
  the services provided on that network.  Documenting the technical and
  administrative decisions made during the implementation and
  administration of the network is therefore of utmost importance for a
  full understanding of the work product.  The corporate history book
  tells us _what_ things happened, and the developers' commit logs show
  _why_ things happened; our job is to tell _how_ they happened.

* Standard data formats and protocols allow us to expand functionality
  and interchange data with future programs and systems without regard
  to future technical decisions.  This is a longwinded way of saying
  that a standards-compliant system is a happy system, and an admin who
  complies with the relevant standards in her field is a happy admin.
  (If nothing else, it makes it easier to seek help when problems arise,
  because problems will invariably arise.)  This is a roundabout way of
  saying that plain text is beautiful.

* Continuously integrating and assimilating new knowledge into old
  practices, as well as continuously improving both hard and soft
  skills, is the single highest professional calling the IT professional
  must answer.  The Japanese call this notion of continuous improvement
  _kaizen_.

## Career Goals

The goals listed below are my professional goals set for the next seven
years.

* To visit developer conferences at least once yearly and as time
  permits.

* To improve my software development skills and assume roles of
  increasing responsibility and complexity within the IT department.

* While I tend to stay away from naming explicit platforms as
  professional development goals, one goal I have is to learn the Apple
  iOS and watchOS platforms, as well as macOS, so that I can develop
  software for Mac, iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.

* To cross-train within the company and bolster my understandings of
  marketing, financial decision-making, customer service & support, and
  user-interface design and experience engineering.

* To delve more deeply into application- and system-level programming,
  including the design and implementation of a programming language of
  my own, and to acquire a deeper understanding of computer security.

* To learn at least one new programming language per year, and more as
  time permits.  Lisp, Swift, Erlang, and Prolog look like interesting
  jumping-off points, as well as picking back up with JavaScript, Ruby,
  and C++.

* To learn to speak a third and fourth language.  (I am debating
  internally as to whether I should select Russian or Japanese as my
  third, and Mandarin or Arabic as my fourth.)

* To write my own operating system.

* To keep current and improve my skills as a general-purpose IT
  administrator, including such topics as DNS, DHCP, file sharing
  protocols, TCP/IP, LDAP and Active Directory, Web servers, encryption,
  system security, network security, PC repair, troubleshooting,
  wireless technologies, and proper maintenance and layout of server
  rooms, including datacenter cable management.

## Long-Term Goal

My long-term goal within the world of technology remains uncertain, but
there are several notions to which I subscribe that will inform that
goal.

* There desperately needs to be more support for young people in East
  Tennessee who are considering a career in any STEM field, particularly
  in technology.

* One of my lifelong dreams is to see my name in a bookstore, and
  publishing a book -- once I know a field deeply enough to justify the
  effort of writing one -- is the surest way to get your name onto store
  shelves.

* The level of technical and digital literacy in this country is [too
  damn low][jimmy].  It baffles me that there are people my age, and
  people younger than I am, with such a low level of technical skills.
  Granted, I'm a total geek and I joke that I was born with a mouse in
  one hand and a keyboard in the other.  Still, digital illiteracy is a
  huge problem.  [It's a problem around the world][aussies], as the
  linked article from an Australian website reveals, and it is only set
  to get worse as time goes on -- unless we do something now. 

* Training people to do jobs that require interaction with a computer --
  and, most crucially, <em>re</em>training those people who are already
  good employees with experience in the workforce, but don't have these
  hard skills -- is of paramount importance.  We have to make it easier
  for the non-geek to learn the tech skills that he or she will need to
  get ahead in life.  Contrary to most, I don't think that making the
  tech easier to use is the answer.  Any reasonably intelligent adult
  can learn enough of Windows, enough of Office, and enough of whatever
  other LOB applications a company uses.  (Stripping out functionality in
  the name of "ease of use" is NOT a good idea.)

* I believe that the workplace -- and, hence, the American business --
  is in a unique position to either provide technical skills training or
  to facilitate its provision.  Hand-in-hand with the almost 1,500
  community colleges in the United States, local companies can work to
  provide technical skills training to employees, job seekers, and
  others.  This training is especially important for youth, minorities,
  women, and Veterans.
