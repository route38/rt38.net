## Skill areas

I am a proud writer and wordsmith.  Writing is among my strongest skills, and I exercise it by writing every day.  My uses of writing include informing, record-keeping, and sorting my thoughts.

### Computer skills

I know computers up and down, inside and out, front to back, and side to side.  I take considerable pride in my system builds and in my abilities as far as using, administrating, repairing, and programming computers are concerned.

I'm an expert Windows user from Windows XP onward, particularly Windows 7 and Windows 10.  I also have considerable knowledge of Debian Linux (my favorite OS) both as a client and as a server.  I've used Windows for almost 20 years and Linux for ten years.  I'm also competent with Macs although I haven't owned a new Mac since 2009.

My overall computing philosophy is rather closely aligned with the Unix philosophy.  A software program must do one thing, it must do that thing exceptionally well, and it must emit standard output formats or offer the capability to do so.  My metaphorical power tool drawer, therefore, contains programs that have this combination of attributes: I use Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome for web browsing, Microsoft Outlook and Ximian Evolution for email, LibreOffice and WordPerfect for word processing, Microsoft Excel for spreadsheets, and a wide array of software on the command line including `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `zsh`, `vim`, and many more.

### Developer tools

I don't write much software nowadays, at least not deliberately.  My favorite editor has almost always been Vim (although I did go through an Emacs phase in college), although I use Sublime Text on Windows.  I favor the Git version control system for managing source code although I've used Mercurial and Subversion in the past.  I use Git and Vim for all my development needs, be they scripting, webdev, applications, or systems.

When I write buildable software, the only languages I use are C and C++, and my build system of choice is `make`.  I'd like to learn Cmake someday, but I've yet to find a project that justifies the trouble.

I have always been disdainful of IDEs since they fly in the face of what I require from my tools.  Nonetheless, I used NetBeans when I did Java in college, and I tried Eclipse and Visual Studio after college.  (I hated all three of them.)  IDEs purport to do everything, they usually do part of "everything" poorly, and they invariably do at least one thing wrong.

### Computer languages

My strongest languages nowadays are C++, Ruby, `bash`, JavaScript, and a little bit of PHP and PowerShell.  I'm familiar with the concepts behind SQL and my only dialect of the SQL family of languages is MySQL.

I also know HTML, CSS, Sass (the significant-whitespace variant is my favorite), Haml, Yaml, XML, TeX, Markdown, and Textile.

My most-used computer languages nowadays are Markdown, `bash`, Ruby, and PHP.

### Quick study

I surprise myself by how quickly I learn things.  (You'd think that wouldn't be the case at age 28...)  Generally speaking, I learn new material as fast as I can get it in front of me.

My favorite example comes from outside of technology, funnily enough.  In 2014, I developed a keen interest in photography and decided to learn how to use a camera the right way -- which is to say, manually.  So I purchased a fine camera -- Canon's legendary AE-1 Program -- and learned how to do everything but developing film.  The AE-1 Program is a manual-focus camera, first of all, and while focusing isn't as hard as you'd think it to be, there was still a learning curve involved.  Second, my chief area of interest in photography is landscapes, and in landscape photography, depth of field is king.  On a higher-spec camera, you'd put it in aperture-priority mode, set it to the desired f-stop, and shoot with gay abandon.  That's not really an option with the AE-1 program since it lacks aperture-priority mode, so if you want to control depth of field, you have to shoot manually.

Now you can follow the light meter -- if it's trustworthy -- and just make sure to shoot a suitably fast film for the conditions, keep your shutter speed high enough to avoid camera shake, and keep the f-stop small enough to avoid overexposure.  That's the way you usually do manual photography, although with experience (and a film with good latitude), you can let your intuition guide you.  For example, my favorite film is the famously finicky Ilford Pan F Plus, a film with less exposure latitude than it lets on.  You *might* get decent results if you're off by an f-stop, but I doubt it.  (If you're shooting Kodak Tri-X, on the other hand, as long as light hits it, you can get a half-decent exposure out of it if you treat it right in the darkroom.)  Pan F is, to put it plainly, a bitchy film to shoot in mixed light because its extra red sensitivity gives it ridiculous contrast.  On top of everything else, Pan F is slow -- ISO 50.  It's not quite as sharp as Delta 100 (a tabular-grain film made to compete with Kodak TMX), but it has less visible grain, and in an 18x24" enlargement of a 35mm negative scan, there is no visible grain.  Film grain has its place, primarily among hipsters, but that place isn't in my landscapes.

Later that year, I taught myself to develop film and assumed complete control over the process from capture to printing.  I shoot film for the character it has (and the fact that unless you buy a camera made for it, black-and-white photography is still better done on film than on digital) and scan it into my workstation for printing digitally.  I like the impact I have on the process by choosing my camera, lens, and filter, then selecting the right film for the job, and ultimately using the combination of the two to create something beautiful in the development and scanning process by choosing a developer that gives good results (Kodak D-76 is my favorite) and scan settings that maximize what I can get out of the negative.

### Bilingualism

I speak French with some degree of fluency.  I find it easier to write, and my skills are a little timeworn from lack of use.  I tested out of college French and received six hours of upper division course credit through the Advanced Placement program.  Other highlights of high school French included passing three of the five courses I took with a 100% average, and getting an A in all five of them.

### Communication

I find it easy to communicate with most people both verbally and otherwise.  I make it my utmost concern to give encouragement and advice to my coworkers and to convey a uniquely dry sense of humor in my communications.  People tell me I am well-spoken and exude maturity in speaking and especially writing.  I do not deny this appraisal of my communication skills, but at the same time I do not confirm it.

## Attributes

Among my strongest attributes are honesty, integrity, punctuality, accountability, respectfulness, resilience, and respect of authority.  I enthusiastically accept new responsibilities and see most opportunities in life as chances to learn.  (The few that remain are chances instead to exercise curiosity, which leads to learning.)

### Intelligence

I am highly intelligent, which is a quality I define by saying that I have a higher-than-average ability to acquire and assimilate information.  My abilities in this regard are such that I take great joy and pride in my ability to connect disparate ideas and create from them a unified whole.

### Punctuality

I am extremely punctual, to the point that in five years of college (roughly 6,500 lectures), I was late to a lecture exactly once: to a math lecture in my freshman year.  Incidentally, on my way to class on my bicycle, I ran over a shard of beer bottle glass and ended up with a flat tire.  Both bike and rider were OK, but I learned the value of leaving early and arriving early.  Whenever I am due to go somewhere, I leave early and arrive early.  It is my opinion that time spent waiting on an appointment is time to spend at catching up on news, catching up with colleagues, or simply making sure all the T's are crossed and all the I's dotted.  Many of my best friendships in college were kindled during what I call social waiting.

### Craftsmanship

A craftsman exalts his tools when he does great work, but has only himself to blame when he does poor work.  To that end, I use the best tools I can either find in the open source community or afford to purchase.  The result is an array of tools whose capabilities I continue to learn and appreciate.  Every part of my toolkit has been selected very carefully, or is currently being used only until I can afford to replace it.  I stay faithful and loyal to the people who have earned my trust, and my tools earn the same respect.

To that end, I only use the best tools and materials, whether real or virtual, to make my programs, websites, photographs, and other productions.  I have begun to discover just how much truth there is to the very true statement that one only gets what one pays for, although I'm also a relentless bargain shopper and sometimes I get a lot more than I pay for.  Even when I work on vintage computers, a hobby of mine, I use only Kobalt, Craftsman, and Stanley hand tools, which offer good value, excellent durability, and adequate precision.  I no longer use the idiosyncratic Linux environment that took years to hone to a razor's edge, but I did so and found it to work to my advantage.

### Enthusiasm

While I am usually quiet and reserved, I exude a quiet enthusiasm for things I know much about, things I want to learn about, and things I just plain love.  Once my enthusiasm breaks through, it becomes rather infectious.

### Promises

I am true to my word, almost to logical absurdity.  My word, without exception, is my bond: if I say I will do something, it will be done in the absence of sufficiently serious extenuating circumstances.

### As a member of a team

I'm slow to take credit for work I do, except to ensure that my name is among the contributors on a group project.  I dislike not being credited for something I do, but I view all my work as being done for the community around me, so I don't press the matter unless the work falsely attributed has come at significant personal cost.  On the other hand, I accept targeted, sincere criticism as a challenge for improvement, and (correctly in my eyes) view insincere or overly generic criticism as a personal attack.

### Respect and loyalty

In my dealings with others, I err on the side of formality out of respect to the other person's station, regardless of that person's position.  I believe that everyone in an organization, from the humblest janitor on to the CEO, deserves genuine respect for contributing to the goals of the company.  In my interpersonal affairs, I come across as deeply and genuinely respectful, an appraisal I will not confirm but do not deny.  Along with respect comes loyalty: once someone earns my loyalty, I do not sway.

### Humility

I exercise great humility in all things.  I learned while still a teen just how powerful humility really is.  Deference to wisdom, regardless of its source, is the most important life skill I have acquired in my twenties, among a slew of skills I've acquired as a twentysomething.
