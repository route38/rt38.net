# William's other blog

_Version 5.1: "Blog 17"_

After some horrifying command line sessions involving merging no fewer
than three separate Git repositories, I _think_ this site might be ready
to try and rebuild.  There is a lot to tease apart since there's been a
lot of changes in the past three years.

This is my non-technical blog, and if for some reason you actually want
to read this horseshit, you can find it at <https://rt38.net>.
