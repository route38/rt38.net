I'm just starting to get into jazz, so any suggestions you have will be
enthusiastically received.  I already have a copy of _Kind of Blue_ to
get me started, as well as a 1959 pressing of "Rhapsody in Blue."

## Live albums, films, and concert footage

I'm interested in any live albums and concert footage from Paul Simon or
Simon & Garfunkel, particularly the 1981 Concert in Central Park and
Paul's 1991 Concert in the Park.  As far as videos go, I'd be open to
Laserdisc or VHS tape, with preference for the former, or a DVD if it is
available.  (I do not own a Blu-Ray player, but I would be open to
buying a LD player just for concert footage.)

I'd love to have a copy of the Eagles Live LP; I have it on CD and it's
a fine set of performances.  (I had a copy of the LPs as a child.)

I'm looking for a copy of the motion picture _One-Trick Pony_, starring
Paul Simon, and the motion pictures _Carnal Knowledge_ and _Catch-22_,
in which Art Garfunkel appeared.

Unrelated to music, I'm looking for any VHS, LD, or DVD programs about
the 1998 and 1999 Denver Broncos, the 2004 or 2007 Boston Red Sox, and
the 1998 Tennessee Volunteers.
