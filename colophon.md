## Type

This site is set in _Alegreya_ and _Alegreya Sans_ by Huerta Tipogr√°fica.
Monospaced text is set in _PT Mono_ by Paratype.

Icons originate from _Font Awesome_ by Dave Gandy and contributors.

## Tools

Since returning to the tech world, I have revamped my usual tech stack.
I am currently running Fedora Linux 34 as my main development OS and Windows
10 as my secondary home OS.  My file server runs Debian Linux via Hyper-V
on top of a Windows 2016 host.

As far as hardware goes, I run a custom-built desktop and server, two Apple
laptops, and two Lenovo laptops.  There's more information about my
[computers](/computers) elsewhere on the site.

My toolchain is larger than I thought it to be and consists of a mix of
proprietary and free tools.

## Server Software

_Route 38_ is hosted by Amazon Simple Storage Service ("S3").

## Production Notes

_Route 38_ is prepared on my Fedora laptop using the latest revision of a
homegrown asset pipeline that builds Sass and Haml externally and folds them
into standard HTML and CSS expected by Jekyll.  I have set things up to where
the entire pipeline can be invoked using `rake`, but this has the following
external dependencies:

* Ruby
* Jekyll
* Haml
* Node v11.15 (required for Gulp)
* Gulp
* Several Ruby and Node libraries

I am currently working on a rewrite of the site's CSS using the latest CSS
features and, most notably, removing the dependency upon Sass.  _The Chain_, the
former CSS framework that powered this site's appearance, was a dumpster fire
with nettlesome dependencies of its own, and using raw CSS -- which now sports
most of the features I once relied upon Sass to provide -- removes a build step
and makes the site easier to deploy.  My next goal is to remove the Haml
templates and revert back to raw HTML -- which will remove the need for Gulp,
allowing me to have a pure-Ruby workflow with no JS dependencies (since I won't need Gulp to build the scaffolds).

This workflow long predates my involvement with the Python language, but it
works (and quite well at that), so I've no intention of changing it solely in
the name of using a different language.

### Web standards

Web standards are vitally important.  If this site looks like crap in your
chosen browser, choose a different browser.
