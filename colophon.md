## Type

This site is set in _Montserrat_ by Julieta Ulanovsky.

Icons originate from _Font Awesome_ by Dave Gandy and contributors.

## Tools

Since returning to the tech world, I have revamped my usual tech stack.
My daily OS is macOS 12.3 "Monterey," running on a MacBook Pro with the
M1 Pro processor.  My toolchain has been considerably streamlined despite
working in two programming languages and several markup languages.

I use macOS 10.7 "Lion" for certain legacy software and Windows 11 for
remote access to my day job and for PC gaming.

PyCharm, by JetBrains, is my usual editor for Python.  For everything
else, I use Visual Studio Code by Microsoft.  I primarily work in Python
and JavaScript and also edit HTML, CSS, Sass, Markdown, Liquid, and
Jinja templates.

My usual Internet browser is Google Chrome.  I read my mail through
Apple Mail.

## Server Software

_Route 38_, like my portfolio site, is hosted by Microsoft Azure CDN.
The source code is stored and tracked on GitHub.

## Production Notes

I build _Route 38_ using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site builder.
I have been using Jekyll since 2014.

This workflow long predates my involvement with the Python language, but it
works (and quite well at that), so I've no intention of changing it solely in
the name of using a different language.
