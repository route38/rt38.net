## Type

This site is set in _Montserrat_ by Julieta Ulanovsky.

Icons originate from _Font Awesome_ by Dave Gandy and contributors.

## Tools

I still edit my Jekyll sites in Vim, although VS Code (my usual editor
for React and other JavaScript/TypeScript shit) has increasing currency.

My daily OS is macOS 12.3 "Monterey" on an M1 Pro MacBook Pro.

My daily programming languages are Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript,
with occasional dives into Ruby and C.

I use macOS 10.7 "Lion" for certain legacy software and Windows 11 for
remote access to my day job and for PC gaming.

My usual Internet browser is Google Chrome.  I read my mail through
Apple Mail.

## Server Software

This site is hosted on a Linode virtual server.

Selected files live on my CDN at <https://waellison.cf>, hosted on
Microsoft Azure CDN.

The source code is stored and tracked on GitHub.

## Production Notes

I build this site using the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) site builder.
I have been using Jekyll since 2014.
